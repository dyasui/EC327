President Kennedy,
please decide whether you want to [Escalate]{.h} the conflict
by launching a full-scale invasion of Cuba to remove all missiles by force.

- If you [Escalate]{.h}, Premier Khrushchev will be given one final chance to respond
  by either launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike or [Back Down]{.h}.
  If both sides choose to escalate (pre-emptive strike vs. invasion), the game ends in Nuclear War.

- If you [Back Down]{.h},
  you will be humiliated and will take the payoff according to what's written
  on your role card.

Choose wisely!
