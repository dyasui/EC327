Presdent Kennedy,
please decide whether you want to [Escalate]{.h} the conflict
by launching a full-scale invasion of Cuba to remove all missiles by force.

* If you [Escalate]{.h}, Kruschev will be given one final chance to respond
by either launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike or backing down.

* If you [Stand Down]{.h},
you will be humiliated and will take the payoff according to what's written
on your role card.

Choose wisely!
