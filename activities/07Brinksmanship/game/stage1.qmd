# The Doomsday Clock is at 6

President Kennedy,
please decide whether you want to [Escalate]{.h} or [Stand Down]{.h}.

* If you [Escalate]{.h}, there is no risk of nuclear war at this stage,
but you can deliver a speech to Premier Kruschev calling for the USSR to send their missiles back.
Kruschev will then get to decide to escalate or stand down in the next stage.

* If you [Stand Down]{.h},
you will take the humiliating payoff of 2
but the game ends here without escalating further.

Choose wisely!
