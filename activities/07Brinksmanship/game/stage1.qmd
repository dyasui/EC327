# The Doomsday Clock is at 6

President Kennedy,
please decide whether you want to [Escalate]{.h} or [Back Down]{.h}.

* If you [Escalate]{.h}, there is no risk of nuclear war at this stage,
  but you can deliver a speech to Premier Khrushchev calling for the USSR to send their missiles back.
  Premier Khrushchev will then get to decide to escalate or back down in the next stage.

* If you [Back Down]{.h},
  you will take the humiliating payoff of 8,
  and the game ends here without escalating further.

Choose wisely!
