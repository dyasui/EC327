**<u>Objective:</u>**

This activity is based on the game developed by Phil Haun and Michael O’Hara to
explore decision-making under risk and the dynamics of brinkmanship. The game
helps illustrate concepts such as escalation, risk tolerance, and backward
induction in strategic situations. It also provides an opportunity to analyze
how uncertainty and risk preferences influence negotiation outcomes.

Under the Mutual Risk of Escalation.* Journal of Political Science Education,

## Game Rules: 

<u>**Setup:**</u>

Find a classmate who you haven't already interacted with in class.

The game begins with a pot of 10 coins to be divided between the two of you.

Have your notebook or device ready to record the results.

<u>**Rounds:**</u>
The game progresses in rounds where one player decides between splitting the
pot or rolling a die. Each round increases the risk of escalation, resulting in
both players losing everything.

  * **Round 1:**
  Player 1 chooses between:

    + Splitting the pot (1 coin for themselves and 9 coins for Player 2).

    + Rolling the die. If the die roll is 1, escalation occurs, and both
    players receive 0 coins. If the roll is greater than 1, the game proceeds
    to Round 2.

  * **Round 2:**
  Player 2 chooses between:

    + Splitting the pot (8 coins for Player 1 and 2 coins for themselves).

    + Rolling the die. If the roll is 1 or 2, escalation occurs. If the roll is
    greater than 2, the game proceeds to Round 3.

  * **Subsequent Rounds:**
  Similar logic follows, with the split amounts changing each round:

    + Round 3: (3, 7)

    + Round 4: (6, 4)

    + Round 5: (5, 5)

    + Round 6: (4, 6)

The risk of escalation increases in each round. By Round 6, rolling the die
becomes extremely risky, with only a 1-in-6 chance of avoiding escalation.

<u>**End Conditions:**</u>

The game ends if:

  * Players choose to split the pot in any round.

  * Escalation occurs after a low die roll.

  * The sixth round is completed with no escalation.

## Play the Game:

Playing the Game

  * Roles:
    + Decide roles for Player 1 and Player 2 within your pair.
    + Use the die rolling simulator below for all die rolls during the game.
    + Keep track of who earned how many coins and reflect on you and your opponent's strategies and thinking.
    + After playing this game against your first opponent, find another classmate to play against a second time.

# Discussion

  * Strategic Analysis:
    + How does the increasing risk of escalation affect your decisions as Player 1 or Player 2?
    + Would you classify yourself as risk-averse, risk-neutral, or risk-seeking? Why?

  * Backward Induction:
    + How can backward induction be used to predict outcomes in this game?
    + Were your opponents’ decisions consistent with backward induction predictions?

  * Risk and Outcomes:
    + Compare the class results to the theoretical expectations of risk-averse, neutral, and risk-seeking behaviors.
    + How does the concept of brinkmanship manifest in this game?

  * Real-World Applications:
    + What real-world scenarios mirror the logic of brinkmanship in this game?
    + How might risk tolerance influence outcomes in international negotiations or business?
