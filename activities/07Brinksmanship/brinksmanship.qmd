# The Game: Rules

You will be assigned a role
of either US President John F Kennedy, or USSR Premier Nikita Khrushchev
and matched with another classmate who will be your counterpart.

Your goal will be to attempt to make your rival back down
by threatening escalation of tensions,
without ending up in a nuclear war^[unless you are a Madman].

<u>**Setup:**</u>
Find a partner.
Decide who will play the role of Kennedy and who will play Khrushchev.
Each of you will receive one role card accordingly.
Keep the role side of your card visible; the opposite side shows your hidden type. Do not reveal the hidden-type card to your opponent during play.

- You will play several rounds over which you will alternate the decision
to either [Escalate]{.h} the conflict or [Back Down]{.h}.

- If one player Backs Down, the game ends in an embarassment for the player
  who backed down, and their opponent will get their favorite outcome.

- Each time someone chooses to [Escalate]{.h}, 
you will roll a die to see whether the conflict led to Nuclear War.

  + If the roll on the die is greater than the number on the countdown clock,
then the game ends in the Nuclear War outcome.
Record your payoffs according to your role card.

  + If the roll on the die is less than or equal to the number on the countdown clock,
  then the game continues to the next round.
  The next player will get the same decision to [Escalate]{.h} or [Back Down]{.h},
  but this time the countdown will have progressed and further escalation will become riskier.

**<u>Payoffs:</u>**

- **Kennedy**'s payoffs:

  + If Khrushchev Backs Down, Kennedy earns a payoff of 10 for the game.
  + If Kennedy backs down, he earns a payoff of 2.
  + If escalation leads to Nuclear War, Kennedy earns 0.

- **Khrushchev**'s payoffs depend on his hidden type:

  + If Khrushchev is a **Dove**,
    * he gets 10 from making Kennedy back down,
    * he gets 5 if he backs down,
    * and 0 if the game ends in Nuclear War.

  + If Khrushchev is a **Madman**,
    * he gets 10 from making Kennedy back down,
    * he gets **0** if he backs down,
    * and **3** if the game ends in Nuclear War.
