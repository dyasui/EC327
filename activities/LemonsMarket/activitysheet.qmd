title: "Market for Lemons"
---

**<u>Objective:</u>**
This activity simulates a used car market where buyers and sellers interact
under conditions of asymmetric information. The goal is to demonstrate how
private information, adverse selection, and outside options influence market
outcomes.

to potentially be featured on NPR's Planet Money podcast.

#### End of Round:
All participants record their earnings:

  * Buyers: Remaining budget + resale value of purchased car (if any).

  * Sellers: Sale profit or scrap value (if unsold).

The roles rotate so that each participant experiences being both a buyer and a seller.

## Discussion Questions

Write these up based on our discussion in class

  * What game theoretic concepts apply to this game?

  * Compare this activity to the Market for Lemons model we discussed in class.
  How well does this game do at teaching the concepts of asymmetric information,
  adverse selection, and market unraveling?

  * What are some other examples of markets in the real world
  which you think could potentially be affected by adverse selection in the same way as the market for lemons?
  What is special about those markets that you think would make them susceptible?
