title: "Market for Lemons"
---

**<u>Objective:</u>**
This activity simulates a used car market where buyers and sellers interact
under conditions of asymmetric information. The goal is to demonstrate how
private information, adverse selection, and outside options influence market
outcomes.

## Game Rules:

### Setup

 * **Starting Resources:**
   Each buyer starts with a budget of £800.
   Each seller starts with one car card.
   Sellers should not reveal the quality of their car to anyone.

* **Car Values:**
  Good Cars: Resale value of £600. Scrap value of £400 (if unsold).
  Lemons: Resale value of £200. Scrap value of £150 (if unsold).

### Gameplay

The game consists of 3 rounds. Each round follows this sequence:

  * **Sellers List Cars:**
    Each seller announces a starting price for their car. This price is public.
    Sellers can choose not to sell their car if they believe the offered price would not result in a profit.

  * **Buyers Bid:**
    Buyers negotiate with sellers to purchase cars.
    Each buyer may purchase only one car per round.
    Buyers may also choose not to buy a car if they believe the prices are too high.

  * **Transactions:**
    Once a buyer and seller agree on a price:

      + The buyer pays the agreed price, which is deducted from their budget.

      + The seller reveals the car’s true quality.

    Sellers record the profit from the transaction (sale price minus car's scrap value).
    Buyers record their remaining budget and the car’s resale value.

#### Outside Options:
Buyers who do not purchase a car keep their remaining budget as their final payoff for the round.
Sellers who do not sell their car receive the scrap value instead:

  * £400 for a good car.
  * £150 for a lemon.

#### End of Round:
All participants record their earnings:

  * Buyers: Remaining budget + resale value of purchased car (if any).

  * Sellers: Sale profit or scrap value (if unsold).

The roles rotate so that each participant experiences being both a buyer and a seller.

## End of the Activity

At the end of all rounds:

  * Reveal the type of car you purchased.
  * Calculate the total profits for each participant across rounds.
  * Discuss how market behavior evolved.

### Record Results:

Buyers and sellers should track their results each round:

  * If seller: type of car you started with, whether you sold, and what price it sold for.
  * If buyer: whether you bought a car, how much you paid, and what type of car it ended up being.
  * Also keep track of how many of each type of car were sold in the class as a whole.

## Discussion Questions

  * As a buyer, what techniques did you use to decide whether to buy a car or not?

  * As a seller, how did you try to convince potential buyers to buy your car?

  * Did the overall market for used cars in class experience *adverse selction*? 
  Why or why not?

  * What are some other examples of markets in the real world
  which you think could potentially be affected by adverse selection in the same way as the market for lemons?
  What is special about those markets that you think would make them susceptible?
