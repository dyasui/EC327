## Split Into Groups

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
# SurvivorGroup <- read_csv("Survivors.csv") %>%
#   select(name, group_name) %>%
#   mutate(group_name = str_remove_all(group_name, "Activity2 ")) %>%
#   mutate(name = sub("(^.*),\\s(.*$)","\\2 \\1", SurvivorGroup$name)) %>%
#   write_csv("SurvivorGroup.csv")

SurvivorGroup <- read_csv("SurvivorGroup.csv") %>% 
  group_by(group_name) %>% 
  mutate(Group = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = group_name, values_from = name) %>% 
  arrange(Group)

knitr::kable(SurvivorGroup)
```

## Set Up

::: {.incremental}
  
  * Find an opposing group
  
  * Pick someone to record flags for each round
  
  * Draw 21 flags on whiteboard
  
  * Discuss strategy w/ your group for 1 minute
  
  * Play the game!
  
    + Don't forget to record how many flags each round!!!

## Modified Rules: choose number of flags to start

Find a new team to play against (losers move)

::: {.incremental}

  * This time, one team will choose the number of starting flags: between 15-25
  
  * The other team will choose whether to allow max. of 2-5 flags per round
  
  * Play and record!

## Discuss 

In your teams briefly discuss the following:
  
  * Is there a correct way to play the game?
  
  * How did you find out the best way to play the game?
  
  * Is the game solved meaning that the winner can be correctly predicted from any point in the game? If so, should the first or second team always win?
  
  * Were there more errors in the first games played than the last games played? Why?
  
  * How was this game different from the guessing 2/3rds game?

## Recap

  * There *is* a correct way to play: we will later call the *Nash equilibrium*
  
  * You likely used some form of *backwards induction* or *rollback* reasoning
  
  * This game was *sequential* unlike the *simultaneous* 2/3rds game
