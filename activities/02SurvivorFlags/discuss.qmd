## Discuss 

In your teams briefly discuss the following:
  
  * Is there a correct way to play the game?
  
  * How did you find out the best way to play the game?
  
  * If everyone is playing optimally, should the first or second team always win?
  
  * Were there more errors in the first games played than the last games played? Why?
  
  * How was this game different from the guessing 2/3rds game?
