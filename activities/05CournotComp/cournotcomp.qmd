**<u>Objective:</u>**
In this activity, you will take on the role of a social media platform
competing with others to attract advertising dollars. Your goal is to determine
how many ad slots to release on your platform, **maximizing your firm’s profit** in
a market where each platform’s choices affect overall ad prices.

Each social media platform (firm) sells digital ad space to companies looking
to reach their audience. The total number of ad slots released by all firms in
the market determines the price advertisers are willing to pay per slot. The
more ad space is available, the less valuable each slot becomes.

## Game Rules:

### 1. Divide into teams:

  Come up with a name for your new social media startup and assign yourselves roles
  (CEO, CFO, Public Relations, Market Analyst, etc.).

### 2. Analyze Ad Market:
  
  You will be shown the market demand curve which represents the willingness to pay 
  of advertising companies on your platforms. 
  Values of $a$ and $b$ will be randomly generated.

  1. Common Demand Curve: 
  $$ P = a - b \times Q $$

  * $P$ is the price per ad slot.
  * $Q$ is the total ad space supplied by all firms (sum of each platform’s ad slots).
  * $a$ and $b$ are constants representing market conditions.

  2. Marginal Cost: 

  * You will all have the same marginal costs $c$ drawn randomly each round.

### 3. Strategize: (5 minutes)

  Discuss amongst your team as to how many ads you will allow for on your platform.
  Your strategy will be an integer quantity of ads slots to produce which will be bought by adverstisers at the going market rate.

### 4. Market Opens:

  After each team has decided on their quantity of ads to produce, I will ask your CEO to report them to me.
  All firms quantities will be totaled and entered into the market demand curve to determine the price you will receive per ad.

### 5. Calculate Profits & Discuss:

  Have your CFO write down the profit you earn this round after all other groups quantities have been entered.
  Also record the demand function's $a$ and $b$ of the round.
  Discuss your firm's annual performance and make adjustments as necessary.
  After class you will submit your total profit after all rounds as well as discussion bullet points
  about how your team came up with a strategy, and how this activity relates to class material.
