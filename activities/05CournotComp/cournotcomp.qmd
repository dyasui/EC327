title: "Social Media Adspace"
filters:
  - shinylive
---

**<u>Objective:</u>**
In this activity, you will take on the role of a social media platform
competing with others to attract advertising dollars. Your goal is to determine
how many ad slots to release on your platform, **maximizing your firm’s profit** in
a market where each platform’s choices affect overall ad prices.

Each social media platform (firm) sells digital ad space to companies looking
to reach their audience. The total number of ad slots released by all firms in
the market determines the price advertisers are willing to pay per slot. The
more ad space is available, the less valuable each slot becomes.

## Group Assignments

```{r makegroups}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

canvas_export <- list.files(path='.', pattern="Grades-EC_327.csv$")

names <- read_csv(canvas_export) |> 
  filter(!(Student %in% c(NA, "Points Possible", "Student, Test"))) |>
  select(name = Student) |>
  mutate(name = sub("(\\w+),\\s(\\w+)","\\2 \\1", name)) 

n = nrow(names)
group_size = 4
num_groups = round(n/group_size)

# set seed to make group selection consistent across sessions
set.seed(2024)
# assign groups and make a table
names %>%
  mutate(
         row_number = row_number(),
         Group = sample(rep_len(1:num_groups, n), n, replace = FALSE)
         ) %>%
  arrange(Group, row_number) %>%  # Sort by group and then row number
  select(-row_number) %>%  # Remove temporary row_number column
  group_by(Group) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group, values_from = name, names_prefix = "Group") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-row) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Game Rules:

### 1. Divide into teams:

  Come up with a name for your new social media startup and assign yourselves roles
  (CEO, CFO, Public Relations, Market Analyst, etc.).

### 2. Analyze Ad Market:
  
  You will be shown the market demand curve which represents the willingness to pay 
  of advertising companies on your platforms. 
  Values of $a$ and $b$ will be randomly generated.

  1. Common Demand Curve: 
  $$ P = a - b \times Q $$

  * $P$ is the price per ad slot.
  * $Q$ is the total ad space supplied by all firms (sum of each platform’s ad slots).
  * $a$ and $b$ are constants representing market conditions.

  2. Marginal Cost: 

  * Since digital ad space has virtually no additional cost per slot, assume marginal cost is zero.

### 3. Strategize: (5 minutes)

  Discuss amongst your team as to how many ads you will allow for on your platform.
  Your strategy will be an integer quantity of ads slots to produce which will be bought by adverstisers at the going market rate.

### 4. Market Opens:

  After each team has decided on their quantity of ads to produce, I will ask your CEO to report them to me.
  All firms quantities will be totaled and entered into the market demand curve to determine the price you will receive per ad.

### 5. Calculate Profits & Discuss:

  Have your CFO write down the profit you earn this round after all other groups quantities have been entered.
  Also record the demand function's $a$ and $b$ of the round.
  Discuss your firm's annual performance and make adjustments as necessary.
  After class you will submit your total profit after all rounds as well as discussion bullet points
  about how your team came up with a strategy, and how this activity relates to class material.

# Round Outline:

### Rounds 1-3:

Repeat game among your original groups, varying the demand curve parameters after each round.

### Round 4-: Fewer groups each round

The tech bubble has burst and with it has disappeared the endless venture capital funding.
Now only the strongest will survive!

The bottom half of firms with the lowest profits in round 3 go out of business.
Their employees will join the remaining firms and play in the next round.

# Discussion

In your submission, include your groups' responses to the following points:

  * What type of game did this activity resemble? 
  What ideas from this class did you and your team use to play this game?

  * How did this game relate to the concept of oligopoly?
  
    + During each of the rounds, were the final quantities produced by firms consistent with 
    what they would be in perfect competition or did they resemble collusion?
    
    + Did any groups try to collude with others?
    If so, were they able to effectively enforce their agreements?

    + Did collusion get easier as the number of firms in the market was reduced?
