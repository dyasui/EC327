\title{Activity 1 - Guessing \frac{2}{3}rds of the average}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
    
For this activity, you will choose an integer between 0 and 100.
Your goal is to make your guess close to the class's average guess
\textit{multiplied by \frac{2}{3}rds}.

The person(s) whose guess is closest to this value rounded to the nearest integer wins.

\section*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What was your thought process behind your guess?
    
    \item If we played again, how would you modify your guess?
        (if at all)

    \item Is there any \textit{best} guess? 
        Does it depend on who else is playing?
