## Discussion

::: {.incremental}
  - Knowing the results, how would you change your strategy?
  - What are the relevant strategic considerations in this game?
  - If we assume that all players are rational, perfectly informed, and believe that all other players are rational,
  what should we predict to be the outcome of this game?
  - Is Common Knowledge of Rationality a 'bad' assumption? How can we connect our theories with experimental evidence?
