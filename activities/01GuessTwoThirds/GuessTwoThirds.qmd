## Activity 1: Guess 2/3rds of the average
::: {.incremental}
  - You will each choose an integer between 0 and 100. 
  - The winner is the person who's guess is closest to the [average of all guesses *times* 2/3]{.hii}
  - Submit your guess on [Canvas](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/courses/233504/quizzes/329305)

## Discussion

::: {.incremental}
  - Knowing the results, how would you change your strategies?
  - This is a simple example, but illustrates how complicated strategic reasoning can be.
  - The theoretical solution to this game says that anyone who is *rational* and knows that *everyone else is rational* (Common Knowledge of Rationality) should only choose 0 or 1. 
  - However, [Nagel, R. (1995), "*Unravelling in guessing games : An experimental study*"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2950991) showed that over 12,000 answers, the average is 35.24.
  - Is Common Knowledge of Rationality a 'bad' assumption? How can we connect our theories with experimental evidence?
