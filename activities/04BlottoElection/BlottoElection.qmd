# Class Activity: Blotto 

## - Presidential Campaign in Battleground States

**Objective:**  

In this activity, you will take on the role of campaign managers for two
presidential candidates in the fictional country of Blotto. Your goal is to
allocate political resources (ads and canvassers) across three battleground
states—Montera, Caldeira, and Pacifica—in a way that maximizes your candidate's
chances of winning the election.

### The Battleground States:

1. **Montera**: The smallest state, meaning it will always receive the least or
   equal amount of resources.

2. **Caldeira**: The second largest state, requiring more resources than
   Montera but fewer than Pacifica.

3. **Pacifica**: The largest state, which will need the most resources to sway
   voters.

### Game Setup: Each player represents a candidate. Your goal is to allocate a
fixed number of political resources across the three states.

  - **Initial Round**: Each player must write down three integers in descending
    order (representing the number of resources spent on Montera, Caldeira, and
    Pacifica). These integers must sum up to 6. 

  - **Reveal**: After writing down your numbers, you and your opponent reveal
    them to each other. 

  - **Win Condition**: You compare your numbers to your opponent's for each
    state: If your candidate has a higher number of resources than the other
    player in two or more states, your candidate wins the election. If the
    numbers are tied in a state, that state is considered a "draw," and you
    only compare the other two.

### Steps for Each Round:

1. **Allocate Resources**: Write three integers that represent how many
   resources you will allocate to Montera, Caldeira, and Pacifica. These
   numbers must always follow the rule:

   - Montera gets the smallest or an equal amount to the other states. Caldeira
     receives more than or equal to Montera but less than or equal to Pacifica.
     Pacifica must get the most or equal to Caldeira.

2. **Reveal**: Once both players have written their numbers, reveal your
   allocations.

3. **Compare and Record**: Determine the winner by comparing your numbers.
   Record which player won the majority of states (i.e., who had the higher
   number of resources in at least two out of three states).

### Rounds:

  * **Round 1**: Each player allocates 6 total resources.

  * **Round 2**: Each player allocates 12 total resources. 

  * **Round 3**: Choose how many total resources you will allocate
    (open-ended). 

  * **Round 4**: Choose how many total resources and and how many battleground
    states (you don't have to adhere to the population ranking).

### Reflection: 

After completing all rounds, reflect on how changing the number of total
resources affected your strategy. Were there certain patterns in how you
allocated resources that were more effective? Did your strategy change as the
resource pool increased or decreased?

### Recording Results: 

For each round, record the following:

  * The three numbers you allocated. The three numbers your opponent allocated.
    The winner of each round (based on the majority of states won).
  
This activity simulates strategic decision-making in real-world campaigns,
where candidates must allocate limited resources effectively to win crucial
battlegrounds!

**Good luck, candidates!**
