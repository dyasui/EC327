**<u>Objective:</u>**
In this activity you will play a game which demonstrates the idea of mixed strategies in simultaneous games.
You will pair up with another classmate to simulate a soccer [penalty shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football))
where each of you will represent different soccer teams.
Your goal is to score more goals than your opponent after taking turns as both the kicker and the goalie.

## Game Rules:

### 1. Pair up and flip to kick first

  Find your opponent and flip a coin to determine who will kick first.
  The other person will be be the goalie and attempt to block the kicker's shots on goal.

### 2. Shoot for best out of 5

A strategy for each player is one of three parts of the goal: 
  * Left
  * Center
  * or Right ^[from the kicker's perspective]
On the count of three, you and your opponent will simultaneously point to a direction which will determine the probability of a goal being scored.

For each combination of strategies, the probability of a goal being scored is given by the table below:

| [Kicker]{.red}, [Goalie]{.blue} | [L]{.blue} | [C]{.blue} | [R]{.blue} |
|---------------------------------+------------+------------+------------|
| [L]{.red}                       | .3         | .9         | .9         |
| [C]{.red}                       | .6         | 0          | .6         |
| [R]{.red}                       | .9         | .9         | .3         |

### 3. Record every kick

After each kick, make sure to **record both players' strategies** as well **whether a goal was scored**.

<u>Google Sheet for Recording:</u>

  * Alternate between you and your opponent being the kicker and goalie until you have both attempted 5 shots each.

  * If there is a tie after 5 kicks each, 
  you will enter *sudden death* where you keep alternating kicks until one player scores and the other misses.

### 4. Repeat with a new opponent

Find your next opponent in the bracket.
If you are knocked out of the bracket, find someone else to play against for fun, 
or observe the competitions of others.

# Discussion

<u>Are penalty kicks played in a *mixed strategy equilibrium?*</u>

This is the question asked by [Ignacio Palacios-Huerta](http://www.palacios-huerta.com/docs/professionals.pdf).
^[Palacios-Huerta, Ignacio. "Professionals Play Minimax," *Review of Economic Studies*, 70 (2003), 395-415]
The data come from 1417 penalty kicks during professional games in England, Italy, and Spain between 1995-2000 .
The choices of the kickers are recorded as either *left* (L), *center* (C), or *right* (R), corresponding to the area of the goal they kick the ball towards.
The goalies choices, L, C, or R, correspond to which area of the goal the goalie dives towards. 

The table below shows the observed probability of a goal being scored for each combination of kicker and goalie choices
simplifying the choice of a kicker down to $Dominant$ representing a right-footed kicker kicking to the left or a left-footed kicker kicking to the left,
and $Non-dominant$ represents kicking to the opposite side.

<u>Scoring Probabilities (payoffs)</u>
| Kicker, Goalie   | $Dominant_g$ | $Non-dominant_g$ |
|------------------+--------------+------------------|
| $Dominant_k$     | 58.30        | 94.97            |
| $Non-dominant_k$ | 92.91        | 69.92            |

The next table shows the frequency with which each combination of these strategies were actually observed during play:

<u>Strategy Frequencies Observed</u>
| Strategy         | frequency (%) |
|------------------+---------------|
| $Dominant_k$     | 42.31         |
| $Non-dominant_k$ | 57.69         |
| $Dominant_g$     | 39.98         |
| $Non-dominant_g$ | 60.02         |

## Assignment:

Calculate the theoretical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium according to the payoff table
and compare with the observed frequencies.

Is the evidence consistent with the hypothesis that penalty kicks are played in an MSNE?
