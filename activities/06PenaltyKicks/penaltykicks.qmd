**<u>Objective:</u>**
In this activity you will play a game which demonstrates the idea of mixed strategies in simultaneous games.
You will pair up with another classmate to simulate a soccer [penalty shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football))
where each of you will represent different soccer teams.
Your goal is to score more goals than your opponent after taking turns as both the kicker and the goalie.

## Game Rules:

### 1. Pair up and flip to kick first

  Find your opponent and flip a coin to determine who will kick first.
  The other person will be be the goalie and attempt to block the kicker's shots on goal.

### 2. Shoot for best out of 5

A strategy for each player is one of three parts of the goal: 

  * Left
  * Center
  * or Right ^[from the kicker's perspective]

On the count of three, you and your opponent will simultaneously point to a direction which will determine the probability of a goal being scored.

For each combination of strategies, the payoffs in the table below
represent the probability of a goal being scored.

| Kicker, Goalie | Left   | Center | Right  |
|---------------:+--------+--------+--------|
| Left           | 30, 70 | 90, 10 | 90, 10 |
| Center         | 60, 40 | 0, 100 | 60, 40 |
| Right          | 90, 10 | 90, 10 | 30, 70 |

For example, if the Kicker kicks to the Left and the Goalie tries to block Left,
there is a 30% chance of the ball going in and the kicker scoring,
but there is a 70% chance that the goalie successfully blocks the goal.

### 3. Record every kick

After each kick, make sure to **record both players' strategies** as well **whether a goal was scored**.

  * Alternate between you and your opponent being the kicker and goalie until you have both attempted 5 shots each.

  * If there is a tie after 5 kicks each, 
  you will enter *sudden death* where you keep alternating kicks until one player scores and the other misses.

### 4. Repeat with a new opponent

Find your next opponent in the bracket.
If you are knocked out of the bracket, find someone else to play against for fun, 
or observe the competitions of others.
