\question%[20]
Imagine a sequential moves version of rock-paper-scissors
where player 2 gets to pick what they will do after player 1 picks.
Please model the game in its extensive form (as a game tree). 
Assume both player 1 and player 2 only care about the result of the game
and have the following preferences over the result of the game:
win $\succ$ tie $\succ$ loss.
\footnote{Ethan Holdahl, University of Oregon }

\begin{parts}
 
  \part Answer the following questions:
  \begin{subparts}
    \subpart[4] How many nodes are there?
    \subpart[4] How many branches are there?
    \subpart[4] How many terminal nodes are there?
  \end{subparts}

  \part[10] Prune the tree as much as possible. How many branches were you able to eliminate?
    (A complete answer should include your drawing(s) of the game tree)

  \part[10]
  Use the same setup, but now imagine player 1's preferences change
  because they want to be seen as a "tough guy".
  Given that what they want to play remains the same,
  they still have the following preferences over the result of the game:
  win $\succ$ tie $\succ$ loss.
  However, they now would prefer to lose playing rock
  than win playing paper or scissors. 
  Please create a new game tree so the payoffs reflect these new preferences.

  Prune the tree as much as possible. 

  How many branches were you able to eliminate?
    (Include your drawing(s))

\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}

  \part
  \begin{center}[!h]
    \include{figures/rockpaperscissors}
  \end{center}
  
  In the figure, dashed lines represent those which have been pruned.

  The tree has 4 nodes, 12 branches, and 9 terminal nodes.

  \part
  In each of Player 2's subgames,
  we can prune the two branches where they would lose or tie
  based on what Player 1 chose.
  We can't prune any more branches
  because Player 1 is indifferent between all outcomes where they lose.

  \part
  \begin{center}[!h]
    \include{figures/rockpaperscissors2}
  \end{center}

  I represented Player 1's preferences as:

  payoff to winning with rock = 4,
  tie with rock = 3, 
  lose with rock = 2,
  win with paper or scissors = 1,
  tie with paper or scissors = 0,
  lose with paper or scissors = -1.

  Because payoffs are \textit{ordinal}, 
  you can choose any values as long as the ranking is the same.

  Now because Player 1 prefers to lose with rock to any other loss, 
  we can prune the branches where they choose either 
  paper or scissors.
  
  The rollback solution is 
  \{ Player 1 chooses Rock, 
  (Player 2 chooses paper if rock,
  scissors if paper,
  and rock if scissors) \}.

  \noindent\rule[0.5ex]{\linewidth}{1pt}
   
  \textbf{Grading:}

  This question is worth 20 points total, 
  with 10 for correctness, 5 for format, and 5 for explanation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
  For part a, each correct number is worth 1 point.

  \item
  For part b, give 1 point if the overall structure is there,
  1 point if the payoffs go to the right node, 
  and 1 point if the correct 6 branches are pruned and no others.
  
  \item
  For part a on the second page (sorry), 
  give 1 correctness point for every correctly pruned branch,
  with -1 point for pruning other branches.
  \end{itemize}

  Scores for formatting and explanation are left up to the grader's interpretation of the rubric.

% \end{parts}
%
% \begin{solution}
%   \begin{parts} 
%     \part Players: $\{ \text{Jack, Diane} \}$
%
%     Strategy sets: $S_{\text{Jack}} = \{ a, b, c \}$
%     $S_{\text{Diane}} = \{ x, y, c \}$
%
%     For Jack, $b$ and $c$ are best responses to $x$,
%     $a$ is BR to $y$,  
%     and $c$ is BR to $z$.
%
%     For Diane, $x$ and $y$ are BR to $a$,
%     $x$ is BR to $b$,
%     and $z$ is BR to $c$.
%
%     There are two strategy profiles where each player's best responses intersect:
%
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item $N_1 = \{ b, x \}$ 
%
%       Jack's strategy is to choose $b$, 
%       Diane's strategy is to choose $x$.
%       Neither have regrets about their strategy choice;
%       given that Jack is choosing $b$, Diane can't get a higher payoff by deviating.
%       Given that Diane is playing $x$, Jack is indifferent between playing $b$ and $c$ but he can't get a strictly higher payoff by deviating. 
%       The resulting outcome is that Jack gets $2$, 
%       Diane gets $3$.
%
%       \item $N_2 = \{ a, y \}$
%
%       Jack's strategy is $a$, Diane's is $y$. 
%       When Jack plays $a$, Dianne is indifferent between $x$ and $y$, but
%       still cannot deviate to a strictly higher payoff.
%       When Diane plays $y$, Jack's best response is $a$ because $2>\{0,1\}$. 
%       The outcome is that Jack gets $2$ and Diane gets $1$.
%
%     \end{itemize}
%
%     These are the only two \textit{pure strategy} Nash equilibria
%     because there are no other intersections of pure strategy best responses.
%     Note that even though $N_1$ Pareto dominates $N_2$ 
%     (Jack is indifferent; $2=2$, and Diane is better off; $3>1$),
%     there is no \textit{unilateral} deviation that would reach $N_1$
%     from $N_2$.
%
%
%     \part
%     See the extensive form game tree below.
%
%     Now the strategy sets are: 
%
%     $S_{\text{Jack}} = \{ a, b, c \}$
%     because Jack still has only one decision node.
%
%     $S_{\text{Diane}} = \{$ any combination $ c_1 c_2 c_3$ where $c$ can be either $x$, $y$, or $z \}$
%     because Diane now has 3 elements in her information set.
%     She knows whether Jack has chosen $a$, $b$, or $c$ before she makes her own choice. 
%
%     I represented each of Diane's strategies as a triple where the first letter represents her choice at node 1, second letter at node 2, and third letter at node 3.
%     So for example, $xyz$ would be the strategy where she chooses $x$ in node $1$, $y$ in node $2$, and $z$ in node $3$. 
%
%     \begin{itemize}
%
%       \item 
%       $\mathbf{N_1} = \{ a, \ yc_2c_3 | 
%       \text{where $c_2$ is $x$, $y$, or $z$;
%       $c_3$ is $x$ or $y$ } \}$
%
%       Any set of strategies in which Jack chooses $a$
%       and Diane chooses $y$ in node $1$ 
%       but doesn't choose $z$ at node $3$
%       would result in an equilibrium outcome of 
%       $({\color{red} 2},{\color{blue} 1})$
%       where Jack cannot deviate to a higher payoff than $2$,
%       and Diane also has no regrets with choosing $y$.
%
%       \item 
%       $\mathbf{N_2} = \{ b, \ xc_2c_3 |
%       \text{where $c_2$ could be $x$, $y$, or $z$;
%       $c_3$ could be either $x$ or $y$ }\}$
%
%       Any set of strategies in which Jack chooses $b$ 
%       and Diane doesn't choose $z$ at node $3$ 
%       would result in Jack choosing $b$ 
%       and Diane choosing $x$ given that jack chooses $b$. 
%
%       The equilibrium outcome of any of these Nash strategy profiles
%       would be $({\color{red} 2}, {\color{blue} 3})$

% \question%[20]
% See the figures below for the data from our in-class activity 2 
% \footnote{You can also find the data on Canvas in the \textit{Activities} folder of the \textit{files} tab}.
% where teams took turns taking flags from a starting pool. 
% Note that in Game 1,
% 6 out of 9 matches were won by the first team to take flags 
% and in Game 2, 3 of 9 matches were won by the starting team.
%
% \begin{parts}
%   \part[10] Using the rollback equilibrium as a predictive model,
%   how many times would you expect the starting team to win 
%   when all agents are \textit{perfectly informed}, \textit{rational},
%   and have \textit{common knowledge of rationality}?
%   Based on the class data, should we \textit{accept} or \textit{reject}
%   this hypothesis?
%
%   \part[10] Based on your observations in class 
%   and the results from other groups, 
%   which of the assumptions above do you think could be modified
%   to create a more accurate model of this game?
%   What modifications would you make,
%   and what alternative hypotheses could you test?
%
% \end{parts}
%
% \begin{solution}
%   \begin{parts}
%
%     \part 
%     The first team can win 100\% of the time by always leaving a multiple of 
%     the maximum flags which can be taken plus one. 
%     So if all teams know the rules of the game then we would predict that
%     100\% of matches will be won by the starting team.
%
%     However, in class only 9 out of 18 matches were won by the starting team. 
%     We can pretty easily reject the 100\% win hypothesis.
%
%     \part 
%     This one is open to interpretation.
%     It might be that not everyone was fully paying attention when the rules were explained and so perfect information doesn't hold.
%
%     One simple hypothesis to test could be that
%     teams were choosing flags to take randomly
%     instead of thinking through all of the backwards induction logic.
%     This would give us a prediction of the first team winning 1/2 of the time,
%     which is what we saw in class.
%     However, you might want to replicate this experiment more than 18 times to be more sure that there acutally is no tendency for the starting team to win.

% \question[20] 
% The countries of Oceania and Eurasia are at war.
% As depicted in the figure, Oceania has four cities â€”
% Argula, Betra, Carnat, and Dussel â€” 
% and it is concerned that one of them is to be bombed by Eurasia.
% The bombers could come from either base Alpha,
% which can reach the cities of Argula and Betra;
% or from base Beta, which can reach either Carnat or Dussel.
% Eurasia decides which one of these four cities to attack.
% Oceania doesnâ€™t know which one has been selected,
% but does observe the base from which the bombers are flying.
% After making that observation, Oceania decides which one 
% (and only one) of its four cities to evacuate.
%
% Assign a payoff of 2 to Oceania
% if it succeeds in evacuating the city that is to be bombed
% and a payoff of 1 otherwise.
% Assign Eurasia a payoff of 1 if the city it bombs was not evacuated
