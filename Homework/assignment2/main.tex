  \part The difference between a regular Nash equilibrium 
  and a Subgame Perfect Nash equilibrium is that:

  \begin{choices}
    \choice A Subgame Perfect Nash equilibrium assumes perfect information
    \choice Mixed strategies cannot be used in Subgame Perfect Nash equilibria
    \CorrectChoice Subgame Perfect Nash equilibria assume that players won't fall for non-credible threats

    \CorrectChoice How much time Owen waits in line for Taylor Swift tickets
    \CorrectChoice How much money TicketMaster charges for a ticket
    \choice Jose is at home and will only go if the stadium is less than 50\% full
    \CorrectChoice Both B and C are continuous strategies
    \choice None of the above are continous strategies

\question[10] 
A game theorist is walking down the street in his neighborhood and finds \$20.
Just as he picks it up, two neighborhood kids, 
Jane and Tim,
run up to him, asking if they can have it.
Because game theorists are generous by nature, 
he says he's willing to let them have the \$20,
but only according to the following procedure:
Jane and Tim are each to submit a written request 
as to their share of the \$20. 
Let $t$ denote the amount that Tim requests for himself
and $j$ be the amount that Jane requests for herself.
Tim and Jane must choose $j$ and $t$ from the interval
$[0,20]$.
If $j + t \leq 20$, then the two receive what they requested,
and the remainder, $20 - j - t$, is split equally between them.
If, however, $j + t > 20$, then they get nothing, and the game theorist keeps the \$20.
Tim and Jane are the players in this game.
Assume that each of them has a payoff equal to the amount of money that he or she receives. 
Find all Nash equilibria.

\question 

Consider a situation in which a student can decide to cheat or be honest on an exam.
If the faculty thinks the student has cheated, 
the faculty member has to decide whether to expel them from the college
or refer them to the Honor Board. 
The Honor Board has to decide whether to expel the student or find them innocent.
The payoffs are ordered, student, faculty, and college.
Assume the board shares the college's payoffs.

\begin{parts}
  \part[2] Find the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium.

  \part[6] Assume now that the board acts like $Nature$, making no deliberate choice 
  but instead expels a guilty student $q\%$ of the time.
  Find All SGPN as a function of $q$.

  \part[2] Relative to the pure threat of explusion alone, who gains and who loses
  from the existence of an honor board that expels probabalistically?

\question

The players in the following game are $Bush$ and $Saddam$. 
$Bush$ suspects $Saddam$ of having Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).
Assume for the game that $Saddam$ does have WMD. 
$Bush$ can rely on $inspections$ or $invade$.
$Saddam$ can $hide$ his WMD or $destroy$ them.
