\question%[20]
Here's a little ditty, about Jack and Diane,
two American kids growing up in the heartland.
The game is below.
\footnote{Cliff Bekar, Lewis and Clark College}

  \begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \setlength{\extrarowheight}{2pt}
    \begin{tabular}{*{5}{c|}}
      \multicolumn{2}{c}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Diane} \\\cline{3-5}

    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

\begin{parts}
  \part[12] Find all pure Nash strategy profiles and outcomes 
    if Jack and Diane move simultaneously.
    Carefully detail and explain the strategy profiles and how they map onto your Nash outcomes.
    
    \part[16] Find all pure Nash strategy profiles and outcomes
    \textit{if Jack moves first}.
    Carefully detail and explain your strategy profiles 
    and how they map onto your Nash outcomes.
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{parts} 
    \part Players: $\{ \text{Jack, Diane} \}$

    Strategy sets: $S_{\text{Jack}} = \{ a, b, c \}$
    $S_{\text{Diane}} = \{ x, y, z \}$

    For Jack, $b$ and $c$ are best responses to $x$,
    $a$ is BR to $y$,  
    and $c$ is BR to $z$.

    For Diane, $x$ and $y$ are BR to $a$,
    $x$ is BR to $b$,
    and $z$ is BR to $c$.

    There are two strategy profiles where each player's best responses intersect:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item $N_1 = \left( b, x \right)$ 

      Jack's strategy is to choose $b$, 
      Diane's strategy is to choose $x$.
      Neither have regrets about their strategy choice;
      given that Jack is choosing $b$, Diane can't get a higher payoff by deviating.
      Given that Diane is playing $x$, Jack is indifferent between playing $b$ and $c$ but he can't get a strictly higher payoff by deviating. 
      The resulting outcome is that Jack gets $2$, 
      Diane gets $3$.

      \item $N_2 = \left( a, y \right)$

      Jack's strategy is $a$, Diane's is $y$. 
      When Jack plays $a$, Dianne is indifferent between $x$ and $y$, but
      still cannot deviate to a strictly higher payoff.
      When Diane plays $y$, Jack's best response is $a$ because $2>\{0,1\}$. 
      The outcome is that Jack gets $2$ and Diane gets $1$.

    \end{itemize}

    These are the only two \textit{pure strategy} Nash equilibria
    because there are no other intersections of pure strategy best responses.
    Note that even though $N_1$ Pareto dominates $N_2$ 
    (Jack is indifferent; $2=2$, and Diane is better off; $3>1$),
    there is no \textit{unilateral} deviation that would reach $N_1$
    from $N_2$.


    \part
    See the extensive form game tree below.

    Now the strategy sets are: 

    $S_{\text{Jack}} = \{ a, b, c \}$
    because Jack still has only one decision node.

    $S_{\text{Diane}}$ =  any combination $ \{ s_1 s_2 s_3 \}; \ \forall s \in \{x,y,z\}$; where $s$ can be either $x$, $y$, or $z$ at each of her information sets (labelled 1,2,3 on the game tree below). 

    I represented each of Diane's strategies as a triple where the first letter represents her choice at node 1, second letter at node 2, and third letter at node 3.
    So for example, $xyz$ would be the strategy where she chooses $x$ in node $1$, $y$ in node $2$, and $z$ in node $3$. 

    \begin{itemize}

      \item 
      $\mathbf{N_1} = \left( \mathbf{a}, \ \mathbf{y} s_2 s_3 \right)$ 
      
      where:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item $s_2$ is $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, or $\mathbf{z}$; 
          \item $s_3$ is $\mathbf{x}$ or $\mathbf{y}$ 
      \end{itemize}

      Any set of strategies in which Jack chooses $a$
      and Diane chooses $y$ in node $1$ 
      but doesn't choose $z$ at node $3$
      would result in an equilibrium outcome of 
      $({\color{red} 2},{\color{blue} 1})$
      where Jack cannot deviate to a higher payoff than $2$,
      and Diane also has no regrets with choosing $y$.

      \item 
      $\mathbf{N_2} = \left( \mathbf{b}, \ \mathbf{x} s_2 s_3 \right) $
      
      where:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item $s_2$ could be $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, or $\mathbf{z}$; 
          \item $s_3$ could be either $\mathbf{x}$ or $\mathbf{y}$.
      \end{itemize}

      Any set of strategies in which Jack chooses $b$ 
      and Diane doesn't choose $z$ at node $3$ 
      would result in Jack choosing $b$ 
      and Diane choosing $x$ given that jack chooses $b$. 

      The equilibrium outcome of any of these Nash strategy profiles
      would be $({\color{red} 2}, {\color{blue} 3})$

    \end{itemize}

\question[10] 
The countries of Oceania and Eurasia are at war.
As depicted in the figure, Oceania has four cities —
Argula, Betra, Carnat, and Dussel — 
and it is concerned that one of them is to be bombed by Eurasia.
The bombers could come from either base Alpha,
which can reach the cities of Argula and Betra;
or from base Beta, which can reach either Carnat or Dussel.
Eurasia decides which one of these four cities to attack.
Oceania doesn’t know which one has been selected,
but does observe the base from which the bombers are flying.
After making that observation, Oceania decides which one 
(and only one) of its four cities to evacuate.

Assign a payoff of 2 to Oceania
if it succeeds in evacuating the city that is to be bombed
and a payoff of 1 otherwise.
Assign Eurasia a payoff of 1 if the city it bombs was not evacuated
and a zero payoff otherwise.
Write down the extensive form game.

    \include{figures/OceaniavsEurasia} 
  \end{center} 

  Note that $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ in the last row are short for the city names.
  Eurasia acts first, so the initial node is labelled accordingly.
  Oceania has only two info sets which are represented with the dashed ovals.
  The $(0,2)$ or $(1,0)$ payoff sets correspond to Oceania choosing the same city that is bombed,
  or choosing a different city respectively.

\question[10] 
A game theorist is walking down the street in his neighborhood and finds \$20.
Just as he picks it up, two neighborhood kids, 
Jane and Tim,
run up to him, asking if they can have it.
Because game theorists are generous by nature, 
he says he's willing to let them have the \$20,
but only according to the following procedure:
Jane and Tim are each to submit a written request 
as to their share of the \$20. 
Let $t$ denote the amount that Tim requests for himself
and $j$ be the amount that Jane requests for herself.
Tim and Jane must choose $j$ and $t$ from the interval
$[0,20]$.
If $j + t \leq 20$, then the two receive what they requested,
and the remainder, $20 - j - t$, is split equally between them.
If, however, $j + t > 20$, then they get nothing, and the game theorist keeps the \$20.
Tim and Jane are the players in this game.
Assume that each of them has a payoff equal to the amount of money that he or she receives. 
Find all Nash equilibria.
