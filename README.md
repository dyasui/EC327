## 📝 Course Description

This course provides a background to the study of strategic interactions.
We will learn some of the basic terms and mathematical tools behind the models that social scientists use to understand the world of interdependent choices.

By the end of this course, students will be well-prepared to apply these models in upper-level elective courses, embark on their own research projects, and make informed decisions in the real-world economy.
Explore the materials to discover how game theory can enhance your understanding and approach to economic challenges!
