  \alert{Dinesh} has let the power of a CEO position go to his head.
  His new confidence/vanity has led him to trying out a new hairstyle,
  but he starts to suspect that there is a non-zero probability 
  that he looks \textbf{ridiculous} to other people.

  Suppose that looking \textbf{ridiculous} is not something that \alert{Dinesh} can 
  subjectively observe about himself, 
  but is only observable by the people around him.
  
  \alert{Gilfoyle} can observe whether or not \alert{Dinesh} looks \textbf{ridiculous}
  and would like it if \alert{Dinesh} embarrassed himself 
  by looking \textbf{ridiculous} in public.

  But he knows that if \alert{Dinesh} thinks he looks \textbf{ridiculous} , 
  he will want to change his look back to the more boring (but less risky)
  style he had as a nerdy programmer.

\begin{frame}{The CEO's new clothes}

   Suppose that \alert{Dinesh}'s preferences (from best to worst) are as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item He wears his \textit{new style} proudly and people think he is \textbf{cool}
    \item He wears his \textit{old style} and people think he looks average
    \item He wears his \textit{new style} but people think it is \textbf{ridiculous}
  \end{itemize}
  
  Suppose that \alert{Gilfoyle}'s preferences are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \alert{Dinesh} looks \textbf{ridiculous} with the \textit{new style}, 
    continues to wear it and gets embarrassed in public
    \item \alert{Dinesh} goes back to his \textit{old style} 
    \item \alert{Dinesh} looks \textbf{cool} with the \textit{new style},
    continues to wear it and people think he's cool. 
  \end{itemize}

  Model this as an asymmetric information game 
  where \alert{Gilfoyle} has the private information 
  of whether \alert{Dinesh} looks \textbf{ridiculous}.
