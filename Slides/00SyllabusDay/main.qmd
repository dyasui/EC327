# Class Expectations

## Prerequisites
 * **Courses:** EC201 *or* EC202

 * **Knowledge:** This class will require you to use some simple algebra and graphing skills. If you felt uncomfortable with the level of math in EC201, I recommend that you review how to solve simple systems of equations, inequalities, and fractions.
   - There are great free resources out there like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra), but always feel free to reach out for help or other suggestions.

## Problem Sets
You will practice what we learn in class on independently.

Each homework assignment will be a few problems that will be similar to what you will see on exams.

::: {.incremental}
  * Learning something new takes practice, so these are designed to help you
  keep up with the concepts

  * You will be graded not only on whether you got a certain answer,
  but also more importantly on *how you communicate your understanding*

    - See Canvas rubric for more info
:::

## Class Activities
You will break into groups to work collaboratively on different activities

    - Relate it to lecture concepts
