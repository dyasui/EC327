# Extensive Form Review
---

### Information Sets
**Recall** 
from our definition of an [extensive form game]{.hi} 
that each *node* represented the *information* available to the player

In general;

::: {.incremental}
 * [Information set]{.hi}: contains *all* decision nodes that a player can tell apart,
 * can contain multiple nodes,
 * but each decision node can only belong to *one* info set at a time

### Kidnap Game Revisited

### Kidnap Game Revisited

::: {.incremental}

   * Nodes $N_3$ and $N_4$ are now part of the same [information set]{.hi}

## Question
What is Vivica's Info Set?

### Alternative way to draw the same game:

### Adding Imperfect Information
::: {.callout-note}
It doesn't matter whether the decisions to kill and pay ransom are happening at the same time or not, 
Only that neither player knows what the other's move is
:::

### Definitions
::: {.callout-tip}
## **Perfect Information** extensive form game
Where all *information sets* are *singletons*;
each player knows which decision node they are at
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## **Imperfect Information** extensive form game
One or more *info sets* are made up of multiple *decision nodes*
