# General Method for Finding Nash Equilibria

## Introduction

The method for finding the Nash equilibrium in a game with continuous strategies is general and applies to many types of games.

### Key steps:
1. Label each player's strategy (e.g., $x$, $y$, etc.).
2. Define each player's payoff as a function of all players' strategies.
3. Maximize each player's payoff by choosing their own strategy, holding the others constant.

**Question:** How does this method apply to real-world competition scenarios?

## Step 1: Labeling Strategies and Payoffs

Suppose we have players 1, 2, and 3, with strategies labeled $x$, $y$, and $z$, and their payoffs $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.

For each player:
$$
X = F(x, y, z), \quad Y = G(x, y, z), \quad Z = H(x, y, z)
$$

### Example: Price Competition
- $x$ and $y$ could represent the prices set by two firms, and the functions $F$ and $G$ represent their profits.

**Question:** Why is labeling strategies and payoffs essential for structuring a game?

## Step 2: Maximizing Payoff Functions

Each player chooses their strategy to maximize their own payoff, considering the strategies of the others as fixed.

To do this, we take the **partial derivative** of each player's payoff with respect to their own strategy and set it to zero.

### Example:
For firm 1:
$$
\frac{\partial F(x, y, z)}{\partial x} = 0
$$

**Question:** What does this partial derivative represent in terms of strategy adjustment?

---

## Step 3: Solving for Best-Response Functions

Solve each equation to find the **best-response functions**. These tell each player the best strategy given what the other players are doing.

For firm 1, the best-response function could look like:
$$
x = f(y, z)
$$

This gives the optimal $x$ for any given values of $y$ and $z$.

---

## Step 4: Nash Equilibrium

The Nash equilibrium occurs where all players’ best-response functions intersect. Solve the system of equations:
$$
x = f(y, z), \quad y = g(x, z), \quad z = h(x, y)
$$

At this point, no player has an incentive to change their strategy.

### Example:
In price competition, the Nash equilibrium is where both firms set prices that maximize their respective profits.

**Interactive Question:** Why is it important that no player has an incentive to deviate at Nash equilibrium?

## Step 5: Handling Multiple Solutions

Some games may have multiple Nash equilibria, while others may have none in pure strategies.

### Discussion:
- Multiple equilibria can occur in coordination games.
- Games without equilibria in pure strategies might require us to consider **mixed strategies** (covered in a later chapter).

## Example Application: Price Competition

In the example of two firms setting prices:
- Label strategies as $P_X$ and $P_Y$.
- Profits $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ depend on both prices.
- Maximize each firm’s profit to find their best-response functions.

Solve for the Nash equilibrium:
$$
P_X = 20, \quad P_Y = 20
$$

## Recap: General Steps for Nash Equilibrium

1. Label each player’s strategies and payoffs.
2. Maximize each player’s payoff with respect to their own strategy.
3. Solve the system of best-response functions.
4. Check for multiple equilibria and the possibility of mixed strategies.

## Interactive Exercise

Now, let’s apply this method to a different game:
- Consider a bidding competition between contractors.
- Use the general method to find the Nash equilibrium for their bids.
