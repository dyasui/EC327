- Discussing the Strengths and Weaknesses of applying Nash Equilibria
  
:::

## Continuous strategies

So far, choices available to our players to are *discrete*

::: {.incremental}
- For example, 2x2 game table, extensive form with a few branches
- Even chess has a *countable* number of strategies available to a player
- In other cases it makes more sense to model strategies as *continous* 
  + (non-countable)

## When Continuous Strategies are Useful
::: {.incremental}
  * Pricing/bidding/etc in dollar amounts

  * Positions in space or in political alignment

  * How much effort to put into a group project

  * Price-setting in competitive markets (Bertrand model)

  * Quantity-setting in competitive markets (Cournot model)

## Best-Responses to Continuous Strategies

Go from *discrete* **best-response** strategies 
to *continuous* [best-response rules]{.hi}

::: {.callout-note}
A [best-response rule]{.hi} *inputs* a value of another player's strategy 
  * and returns a real number: the optimal value in *response*
:::

::: {.incremental}
  * Because there might be multiple values to one input value,
    - they are technically *correspondances*,
    - but you can treat them like *functions*
  * this means we can't use payoff matrices to represent these games anymore,
  * instead we will graph these strategies in Cartesian coordinate systems
