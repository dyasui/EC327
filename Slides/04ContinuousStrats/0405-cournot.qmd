# Cournot Duopoly

## Cournot vs Bertrand

In the smart phone game, both players set *prices*
  
  * We call that a [Bertrand]{.hi} model of oligopoly

We could also imagine firms choosing *quantities*

  * We'll call this the [Cournot]{.hi} model

## Cournot Competition: Creating the Payoff Functions
::: {.incremental}

* First of all, we need payoff functions for each player.

* *Payoffs: profits*: $\Pi(q) TR - TC = Pq - c(q)$.

* Common demand curve: $P = 100 - Q$,
  - with two firms, so $P = 100 - q_1 - q_2$.

* Both have $MC=10$

## Cournot Competition: Creating the Payoff Functions
This gives us:
$$
\begin{align}
{\color{red}\pi_1} &= (100 - {\color{red}q_1} - {\color{blue}q_2}){\color{red}q_1} - 10{\color{red}q_1} & {\color{blue}\pi_2} &= (100 - {\color{red}q_1} - {\color{blue}q_2}){\color{blue}q_2} - 10{\color{blue}q_2}\\
&= 100{\color{red}q_1} - {\color{red}q_1}^2 - {\color{red}q_1}{\color{blue}q_2} - 10{\color{red}q_1} & &= 100{\color{blue}q_2} - {\color{red}q_1}{\color{blue}q_2} - {\color{blue}q_2}^2 - 10{\color{blue}q_2}\\
&= 90{\color{red}q_1} - {\color{red}q_1}^2 - {\color{red}q_1}{\color{blue}q_2} & &= 90{\color{blue}q_2} - {\color{red}q_1}{\color{blue}q_2} - {\color{blue}q_2}^2\\
&= (90 - {\color{blue}q_2}){\color{red}q_1} - {\color{red}q_1}^2 & &= (90 - {\color{red}q_1}){\color{blue}q_2} - {\color{blue}q_2}^2
\end{align}
$$

## Cournot Competition: Finding Best-Response Functions
These best-response functions are in the by-now familiar quadratic form. 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{d {\color{red}q_1}}\left[(90 - {\color{blue}q_2}){\color{red}q_1} - {\color{red}q_1}^2\right] = 0, &
\frac{d}{d {\color{blue}q_2}}\left[ (90 - {\color{red}q_1}){\color{blue}q_2} - {\color{blue}q_2}^2\right]= 0
\end{align}
$$

Both of them have negative squared terms, so we can look for a maximum:
$$
\begin{align}
{\color{red}BR_1}(q_2) &= \frac{(90 - {\color{blue}q_2})}{2(1)} & {\color{blue}BR_2}(q_1) &= \frac{(90 - {\color{red}q_1})}{2(1)}\\
    &= 45 - \frac{{\color{blue}q_2}}{2}      &     &= 45 - \frac{{\color{red}q_1}}{2}
\end{align}
$$

## Cournot Oligopoly: Finding Nash Equilibrium

Solve these best-response rules as a system of equations:
$$
\begin{align}
{\color{red}q_1} &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}{\color{blue}q_2}\\
{\color{blue}q_2} &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}{\color{red}q_1}\\
\implies {\color{red}q_1} &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}(45 - \frac{1}{2}{\color{red}q_1}) & {\color{blue}q_2} &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}(30)\\
{\color{red}q_1} &= 45 - \frac{45}{2} + \frac{1}{4}{\color{red}q_1} & &= 45 - 15\\
\frac{3}{4}{\color{red}q_1} &= \frac{45}{2} & {\color{blue}q_2}^* &= \boxed{30}\\
{\color{red}q_1}^* &= \boxed{30}
\end{align}
$$

## Cournot outcome

Compare to other market outcomes:

  * Bertrand with symmetric marginal costs, $P_1^{B*}=P_2^{B*}=MC$, profits were zero

In this model:

  * $P_1^{C*}=P_2^{C*}=30 > MC= 10$

  * $\pi^{C*} = (100-30-30)(30) - 10(30) = \$900$

In Monopoly:

  * $P_M^* = \$55$, $Q_M = 45$, $\pi_M = \$2,025$

## Extending Cournot competition

Let’s extend this:

* **What happens when a third firm enters the market?**

  - Would prices fall? Would all three firms set similar prices?

* What other real world factors affect competitive outcomes?

<!-- ## Another Cournot Example
> Crude oil is transported across the globe in enormous tanker ships called
> Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). By 2001, more than 92% of all new
> VLCCs were built in South Korea and Japan. Assume that the price of new
> VLCCs (in millions of dollars) is determined by the function $P = 180 - Q$,
> where $Q = q_{Korea} + q_{Japan}$. (That is, assume that only Japan and Korea
> produce VLCCs, so they are a duopoly.) Assume that the cost of building
> each ship is $30 million in both Korea and Japan. That is, $c_{Korea} = c_{Japan} = 30$,
> where the per-ship cost is measured in millions of dollars.

## Conclusion: The Economics of Oligopoly

In an oligopoly:

* Firms’ prices (quantities) are interdependent.

* Type of competition matters (price vs quantity)

* The best-response functions allow us to determine equilibrium prices (or quantities in Bertrand).
