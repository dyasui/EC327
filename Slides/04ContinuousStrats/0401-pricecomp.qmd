# Continuous Strategies

## Allowing for an infinite set of possible strategies

So far, in both *sequential* and *simultaneous* games,
we have restricted the sets of choices available to our players to 
**finite** sets.

::: {.incremental}
- Even more complicated games like chess have a *countable* number of strategies available to a player
- While this can sometimes make it simpler to solve for games with *discrete* strategies, 
in other cases it can make more sense to model the choices to players on some *continuum*
:::

## Cases where Continuous Strategies are Useful
::: {.incremental}
  * Pricing/bidding/etc in dollar amounts
    + Even if there is some minimum unit (like a cent),
    when there are many options with an obviuous ordering 
    it still makes sense to use continuous values

  * Positions in space
    + For example, you could choose to place your franchise 1 mile away from your competitors, 
    100 yards, 1 foot etc.,

## Extending Best-Response to Continuous Variables

For our model of price competition, 
we will extend the method of finding *discrete* **best-response** strategies 
to continuous [best-response rules]{.hi}

> A [best-response rule]{.hi} takes the value of another player's continuous strategy as an *input* 
and returns another continuous value as the best response to that strategy

::: {.incremental}
  * this means we can't use payoff matrices to represent these games anymore,
  * instead we will graph these strategies in Cartesian coordinate systems

## Setup: Xavier and Yvonne's Competition

Two restaurants in Yuppie Haven: Xavier’s Tapas Bar and Yvonne’s Bistro.

Each place serves the exact same menu, can only compete based on how much they charge.

  * This makes this game a good application of *continuous* strategies because there are many different values which a menu price could take.

  * Also, each restaurant's payoff is represented by a [continuous payoff function]{.hi}
    + In this case, the payoff is the restaurant's **profit** which can take on any dollar value and depends on the price and quantity sold by the competing restaurant

---

## Assumptions:
* Both set prices simultaneously.
* Costs per customer: $8.
* Demand depends on both prices:

  + $Q_X = 44 - 2P_X + P_Y$ 

  + $Q_Y = 44 - 2P_Y + P_X$ 
 
Where:

* $Q_X$ is the quantitiy of meals sold and $P_X$ is the price charged by Xavier

* $Q_Y$ is the quantity sold and $P_Y$ is the price charged by Yvonne

::: {.incremental}
Notice how each restaurant's demand depends on thier competitior

## Profit Functions

Xavier’s profit is calculated based on his price and number of customers:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_X & = (\text{price} - \text{cost})(\textbf{quantity sold}) \\
      & = (P_X - 8)\mathbf{(44 - 2P_X + P_Y)}
\end{align}
$$

Yvonne's profit follows a similar formula.

**How might we derive the best price for each?**

---

## Step 1: Expand Xavier's Profit Function

Let’s expand Xavier’s profit function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_X & = (P_X - 8)(44 - 2P_X + P_Y) \\
      & = P_X(44 + P_Y - 2P_X) - 8(44 + P_Y - 2P_X)
\end{align}
$$

---

## Step 2: Simplify the Expanded Profit Function

Let’s expand Xavier’s profit function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_X & = (P_X - 8)(44 - 2P_X + P_Y) \\
      & = P_X(44 + P_Y - 2P_X) - 8(44 + P_Y - 2P_X)
\end{align}
$$

Now, multiply out the terms:

$$
44 P_X + P_X P_Y - 2 P_X^2 - 352 - 8 P_Y + 16 P_X
$$

**What should we do next to find the best price?**

---

## Step 3: Deriving Xavier’s Best-Response Function

To find the best price, we differentiate $\pi_X$ with respect to $P_X$.

### Differentiation:
$$
\frac{d\pi_X}{dP_X} = 44 + P_Y - 4P_X + 16 = P_Y + 60 - 4P_X
$$

Set the derivative equal to zero for maximization:
$$
P_Y + 60 - 4P_X = 0
$$
Solve for $P_X$:
$$
P_X^* = 15 + 0.25P_Y
$$

---

## For those without Calculus background

The profit function we wrote out in step 2 seems complicated, so lets simplify it:

$$
\pi_X = - 352 - 8 P_Y +  \mathbf{P_X} (60 + P_Y) - 2 \mathbf{P_X}^2 
$$

As Xavier, we can only set our own price, $P_X$, 
everything else we can just treat as a constant

This fits a more general pattern:

$$
Y = A + BX - CX^2
$$

---

## For those without Calculus background

$$
Y = A + BX - CX^2
$$

If we want to find the maximum of $Y$ in this equation as a function of $X$, 
as long as $C>0$, this will take the shape of a parabola with a single peak.

::: {.incremental}
  * The maxmimum of this function will be reached at:
  * $X^* = \frac{B}{2C}$
:::

---

## For those without Calculus background

So going back to Xavier's profit function, 

  * If $B = 60 + P_Y$
  * and $C = 2$

then applying that the maximum choice will meet $\frac{B}{2C}$, 

we get the same answer of 
$P_X^* = 15 + 0.25P_Y$

## Step 4: Yvonne's Best-Response Function

Yvonne’s problem is symmetric, so we can derive her best-response function similarly:
$$
P_Y = 15 + 0.25P_X
$$

### **Question:** How do we find the Nash equilibrium from these two best-response functions?

::: {.incremental}
  * We have one best response rule for each player as a function of the other player's pricing strategy
  * I.e., a system of *two equations* and *two unknowns*
:::

---

## What is a NE in this situation?

Recall that a NE is a stable configuration of strategies in which each player is best responding to the other

::: {.incremental}
  * So in this case, when each player is setting a price that maximizes their profits **conditional on the other player's price**,
  there will be no incentive to change price
  * In other words, we can plug in one player's best response rule into the other player's best response rule to solve for the equilibrium price
:::

## Step 5: Solve for Nash Equilibrium

We solve the system of equations for $P_X$ and $P_Y$:
$$
P_X = 15 + 0.25P_Y
$$
$$
P_Y = 15 + 0.25P_X
$$

---

## Step 5: Solve for Nash Equilibrium

Substitute one equation into the other:
$$
P_Y = 15 + 0.25(15 + 0.25P_Y)
$$
Simplify:
$$
P_Y = 15 + 3.75 + 0.0625P_Y
$$
Solve for $P_Y$:
$$
P_Y = 20
$$

Then, plug $P_Y = 20$ back into the first equation:
$$
P_X = 15 + 0.25(20) = 20
$$

---

## Step 6: Conclusion

At equilibrium:

- $P_X = 20$, $P_Y = 20$

- Both restaurants charge $20, serve 2,400 customers per month, and make a monthly profit of $28,800.
