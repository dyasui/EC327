# Price Competition with Differentiated Products

## Setup: Apple and Samsung's Competition

Instead of a symmetric game, let's try one with *differentiated* products

For example, the market for smartphones.

Let's assume only two players; A(pple) and S(amsung).

  *  $D_A(P_A,P_S) = 100 - 2P_A + P_S$ 

   - The higher $P_A$, fewer iPhones sold

   - The higher $P_S$, more people switch from Galaxy to iPhone

## Apple's Profit Function

Tim Cook’s profit based on his price and number of iPhone customers:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (\text{price} - \text{cost})(\textbf{quantity sold}) \\
      & = (P_A - 10)\mathbf{(100 - 2P_A + P_S)}
\end{align}
$$

Assume a marginal cost of 10 per unit for iPhones

---

## Samsung's Profit Function

Samsung's profit based on prices and number of Galaxys sold:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_S & = (P_S - 30)\mathbf{(100 - 2P_S + P_A)}
\end{align}
$$

Assume Samsung has a higher cost of 30 per Galaxy produced

---

## Step 1: Expand Apple's Profit Function

Let’s expand Apple’s profit function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (P_A - 10)(100 - 2P_A + P_S) \\
      & = P_A(100 + P_S - 2P_A) - 10(100 + P_S - 2P_A)
\end{align}
$$

---

## Step 2: Simplify the Expanded Profit Function

Let’s expand Apple’s profit function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (P_A - 10)(100 - 2P_A + P_S) \\
      & = P_A(100 + P_S - 2P_A) - 10(100 + P_S - 2P_A)
\end{align}
$$

Now, multiply out the terms:

$$
100 P_A + P_A P_S - 2 P_A^2 - 1000 - 10 P_S + 20 P_A
$$

**What should we do next to find the best price?**

---

## Step 3: Deriving Apple’s Best-Response Function

To find the best price, we differentiate $\Pi_A$ with respect to $P_A$.

### Differentiation:
$$
\frac{d\pi_A}{dP_A} = 100 + P_S - 4P_A + 20 = P_S + 120 - 4P_A
$$

Set the derivative equal to zero for maximization:
$$
P_S + 120 - 4P_A = 0
$$
Solve for $P_A$:
$$
BR_A(P_S) = 30 + 0.25P_S
$$

---

## For those without Calculus background

The profit function we wrote out in step 2 seems complicated, so lets simplify it:

$$
\pi_A = - 1000 - 10 P_S +  \mathbf{P_A} (120 + P_S) - 2 \mathbf{P_A}^2 
$$

As Apple, we can only set our own price, $P_A$, 
everything else we can just treat as a constant

This fits a more general pattern:

$$
S = A + BA - CA^2
$$

---

## For those without Calculus background

$$
S = A + BA - CA^2
$$

If we want to find the maximum of $S$ in this equation as a function of $A$, 
as long as $C>0$, this will take the shape of a parabola with a single peak.

::: {.incremental}
  * The maxmimum of this function will be reached at:
  * $A^* = \frac{B}{2C}$
:::

---

## For those without Calculus background

So going back to Apple's profit function, 

  * If $B = 120 + P_S$
  * and $C = 2$

then applying that the maximum choice will meet $\frac{B}{2C}$, 

we get the same answer of 
$P_A^* = 30 + 0.25P_S$

## Step 4: Samsung's Best-Response Function

Samsung’s best-response function is similar:

$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (P_S - 30)(100 - 2P_S + P_A) \\
      & = 100P_S - 2P_S^2 + P_A P_S - 3000 + 60P_S - 30P_A
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\pi_S}{dP_S} & = 0 \\
100 - 4P_S + P_A + 60 & = 0 \\
BR_S(P_A) & = 40 + .25P_A
\end{align*}
$$

### **Question:** How do we find the Nash?

::: {.incremental}
  * We have one best response rule for each player 
    - as a function of the other player's pricing strategy
  * I.e., a system of *two equations* and *two unknowns*
:::

---

## What is a NE in this situation?

A Nash is a stable configuration of strategies 

  - in which each player is best responding to the other

::: {.incremental}
  * When each player is setting profit-maximizing price
    - **conditional on the other player's price**,
    - there will be no incentive to change price
  * Plug in one player's best response rule *into the other player's best response rule*
    - to solve for the equilibrium price
:::

## Step 5: Solve for Nash Equilibrium

We solve the system of equations for $P_A$ and $P_S$:
$$
P_A = 30 + 0.25P_S
$$
$$
P_S = 40 + 0.25P_A
$$

---

## Step 5: Solve for Nash Equilibrium

Substitute one equation into the other:
$$
P_A = 30 + 0.25(40 + 0.25P_S)
$$
Simplify:
$$
P_A = 30 + 10 + 0.0625P_A
$$
Solve for $P_S$:
$$
\begin{align*}
  P_A(1-0.0625) & = 40 \\
  P_S & = 42.67
\end{align*}
$$

Then, plug $P_S = 20$ back into the first equation:
$$
P_S = 40 + 0.25(42.67) = 50.67
$$

---

## Step 6: Conclusion

At equilibrium:

* $P_A = 42.67$, $P_S = 50.67$

* Do either firm have an incentive to deviate?

  - How would we check?
