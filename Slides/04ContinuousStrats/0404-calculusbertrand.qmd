# Price Competition with Differentiated Products

## Setup: Apple and Samsung's Competition

Instead of a symmetric game, let's try one with *differentiated* products

For example, the market for smartphones.

Let's assume only two players; A(pple) and S(amsung).

  *  $D_A(P_A,P_S) = 100 - 2P_A + P_S$ 

   - The higher $P_A$, fewer iPhones sold

   - The higher $P_S$, more people switch from Galaxy to iPhone

## Apple's Profit Function

Tim Cook’s profit based on his price and number of iPhone customers:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (\text{price} - \text{cost})(\textbf{quantity sold}) \\
      & = (P_A - 12)\mathbf{(100 - 2P_A + P_S)}
\end{align}
$$

Assume a marginal cost of 12 per unit for iPhones

---

## Samsung's Profit Function

Samsung's profit based on prices and number of Galaxys sold:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_S & = (P_S - 20)\mathbf{(100 - 2P_S + P_A)}
\end{align}
$$

Assume Samsung has a higher cost of 20 per Galaxy produced

---

## What is a NE in this situation?

A Nash is a stable configuration of strategies 

  - in which each player is best responding to the other

::: {.incremental}
  * When each player is setting profit-maximizing price
    - **conditional on the other player's price**,
    - there will be no incentive to change price
  * Plug in one player's best response rule *into the other player's best response rule*
    - to solve for the equilibrium price
:::

## Step 1: Expand Apple's Profit Function

Let’s expand Apple’s profit function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (P_A - 12)(100 - 2P_A + P_S) \\
      & = P_A(100 + P_S - 2P_A) - 12(100 + P_S - 2P_A)
\end{align}
$$

---

## Step 2: Simplify the Expanded Profit Function

Let’s expand Apple’s profit function:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (P_A - 10)(100 - 2P_A + P_S) \\
      & = P_A(100 + P_S - 2P_A) - 12(100 + P_S - 2P_A)
\end{align}
$$

Now, multiply out the terms:

$$
100 P_A + P_A P_S - 2 P_A^2 - 1200 - 12 P_S + 24 P_A
$$

**What should we do next to find the best price?**

---

## Step 3: Deriving Apple’s Best-Response Function

To find the best price, we differentiate $\Pi_A$ with respect to $P_A$.

### Differentiation:
$$
\frac{d\pi_A}{dP_A} = 100 + P_S - 4P_A + 24 = P_S + 124 - 4P_A
$$

Set the derivative equal to zero for maximization:
$$
P_S + 124 - 4P_A = 0
$$
Solve for $P_A$:
$$
BR_A(P_S) = 31 + \frac{1}{4}P_S
$$

---

## For those without Calculus background

Simplify profit function from step 2:

$$
\pi_A = {\color{purple}- 1200 - 12 P_S} +  \mathbf{P_A} {\color{blue}(124 + P_S)} - {\color{green}2} \mathbf{P_A}^2 
$$

Apple's profit $\pi_A$, depends on their choice variable, $P_A$ 
  * everything else we can just treat as *constant*

This fits a more general pattern:

$$
y = {\color{purple}A} + {\color{blue}B}x - {\color{green}C}x^2
$$

---

## For those without Calculus background

$$
f(x) = A + Bx - Cx^2
$$

We want to find the maximum of $f(x)$

  * as long as $C>0$, this will take the shape of a parabola with a single peak.

::: {.incremental}
  * The maxmimum of this function will be reached at:
  * $x^* = \frac{B}{2C}$
:::

---

## For those without Calculus background

$$
\pi_A = {\color{purple}- 1200 - 12 P_S} +  \mathbf{P_A} {\color{blue}(124 + P_S)} - {\color{green}2} \mathbf{P_A}^2 
$$

So going back to Apple's profit function, 

  * If $\color{blue}B = 124 + P_S$
  * and $\color{green}C = 2$

then applying that the maximum choice will meet $\frac{B}{2C} = \frac{\color{blue}124+P_S}{2\times {\color{green} 2}}$, 

we get the same answer of 
$P_A^* = \frac{124 + P_S}{4}$

## Step 4: Samsung's Best-Response Function

Samsung’s best-response function is similar:

$$
\begin{align}
\pi_A & = (P_S - 20)(100 - 2P_S + P_A) \\
      & = 100P_S - 2P_S^2 + P_A P_S - 2000 + 40P_S - 20P_A
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\pi_S}{dP_S} & = 0 \\
100 - 4P_S + P_A + 40 & = 0 \\
BR_S(P_A) & = 35 + .25P_A
\end{align*}
$$

---

## **Question:** How do we find the Nash?

$$
P_A = 31 + 0.25P_S
$$
$$
P_S = 45 + 0.25P_A
$$

::: {.incremental}
  * We have one best response rule for each player 
    - as a function of the other player's pricing strategy
  * I.e., a system of *two equations* and *two unknowns*
:::

---

## Step 5: Solve for Nash Equilibrium

We solve the system of equations for $P_A$ and $P_S$:
$$
P_A = 31 + 0.25P_S
$$
$$
P_S = 35 + 0.25P_A
$$

Remember the following from definition of Nash:
  
  * both players' strategies are their best responses

  * equilibrium is intersection of best responses

---

## Step 5.1: Transform equations

Either solve for Apple or Samsung's price first.

  * I'll start by solving for Samsung's:

    - From Apple's Best response:
$$
\color{purple}
P_A = \frac{124 + P_S}{4}
$$

   - We can re-arrange Samsung's best response for $P_A$ in terms of $P_S$:

$$
\color{blue}
\begin{align}
P_S = \frac{140+P_A}{4} \\
\Rightarrow 4P_S - 140 = P_A
\end{align}
$$

Solve for $P_S$:

---

## Step 5.2: Solve for one variable
We're going to use the fact that $P_A=BR_A$ in equilibrium:
$$
\begin{align}
  {\color{blue}4P_S - 140} & = {\color{purple} \frac{124 +P_S}{4}} \\
  \Rightarrow 16P_S - 560 & = 124 + P_S \\
  \Rightarrow P_S^* & = \frac{684}{15} = 45.6 \\
\end{align}
$$

When Samsung sets $P_S=45.6$, Apple's best response will fulfill Samsung's belief.

---

## Step 5.3: Solve for the other variable

We could go throught steps 5.1-5.2 to solve for Apple's eqm strategy.

  * Or we could just use their best-response to Samsung's eqm strategy!

We already solved for $P_S^*=45.6$, so plug it into $BR_A(P_S^*)=P_A^*$
$$
\begin{align}
  P_A^* & = 4{\color{green}P_S^*} -140 \\
      & = 4\times{\color{green} \frac{684}{15}} - 140 \\
      & = 182.4 - 140 = 42.4 \\
\end{align}
$$

---

## Step 6: Conclusion

In our Bertrand equilibrium:

* $P_A = 42.4$, $P_S = 45.6$

* $\Pi_A(P_A^*, P_S^*) = \$1,848.32$

* $\Pi_S(P_A^*, P_S^*) = \$1,720.32$

  - Apple's lower MC results in lower eqm price, higher profit than Samsung

* Unlike Bertrand model with perfect substitutes,

  - here firms earn positive profit because of product *differentiation*

* Do either firm have an incentive to deviate?
