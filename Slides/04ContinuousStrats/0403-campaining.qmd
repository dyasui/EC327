# Political Campaign Advertising

## Setup: Competing with Ads

Two political parties, L and R, are competing in an election by spending money on campaign advertising.

### Key Concepts:
- **Vote shares** depend on each party's advertising:
  - If party L spends $x$ million dollars and party R spends $y$ million dollars:
    - Party L’s vote share is $\frac{x}{x + y}$
    - Party R’s vote share is $\frac{y}{x + y}$

**Question:** How might spending more on ads increase one party’s vote share?

---

## Step 1: Payoffs for Each Party

Each party’s payoff is its vote share minus the cost of its advertising.

- **L's payoff**: 
  $$
  100 \times \frac{x}{x + y} - x
  $$
- **R's payoff**: 
  $$
  100 \times \frac{y}{x + y} - y
  $$

---

## Step 2: Best-Response Functions

To find the best-response functions for each party, we use calculus.

### **For Party R**:
- Differentiate R’s payoff with respect to $y$:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dy} \left( 100 \times \frac{y}{x + y} - y \right) = 0
  $$
- Simplifying:
  $$
  100 \times \frac{x}{(x + y)^2} = 1
  $$
- This gives R’s best-response function:
  $$
  y = 10 \sqrt{x} - x
  $$

---

## Step 3: Party L's Best Response

By symmetry, Party L’s best-response function is:
$$
x = 10 \sqrt{y} - y
$$

**Question:** How do you think these best-response functions help us find the Nash equilibrium?

---

## Step 4: Solving for Nash Equilibrium

We solve for $x$ and $y$ by substituting the best-response functions into each other.

- From $y = 10 \sqrt{x} - x$, substitute into L’s equation:
  $$
  x = 10 \sqrt{10 \sqrt{x} - x} - (10 \sqrt{x} - x)
  $$
  Solve this system to find $x = y = 25$.

**Question:** What does this tell us about each party’s optimal spending?

## Step 5: Interpretation of Results

At equilibrium:
- Both parties spend $25 million on ads.
- Neither party can improve its vote share by changing its spending.

### Discussion:
- In this case, both parties overspend compared to the social optimum. This situation is similar to a **prisoner's dilemma**.

---

## Step 6: Socially Optimal Solution

In the **prisoner's dilemma** structure, both parties would be better off if they reduced their advertising spending, saving money without losing votes.

**Question:** Why don’t the parties naturally reduce their spending to reach this optimal outcome?

---

## Asymmetries in Political Advertising

What if one party has an advantage, such as lower advertising costs or more effective ads?

- If Party R’s advertising dollars are twice as effective, its best-response curve shifts upwards, and it spends more than L.

**Question:** How might this advantage affect the equilibrium?

---

## Conclusion: Political Campaigns as a Game

- Political campaigns can be viewed as strategic games where each party competes for votes through advertising.
- While competition leads to higher spending, the results resemble a prisoner's dilemma, where both parties might benefit from cooperation.

---

## Interactive Exercise

**What if**:
- There are three competing political parties?
- Or one party has access to a significantly larger budget?

**Discuss with your peers how this might change the outcome of the advertising game.**
