# Critical Discussion of the Nash Equilibrium Concept

## Discussion of Nash Equilibrium

Now that you've learned what it means and seen it applied to several different games,
*what do you think about the concept of [Nash Equilbrium]{.hi}?*

::: {.incremental}
- Does it make intuitive sense? Do you think people really reason through their **best response** to any possible situation?
- Is there anything relevant to strategic interactions you can think of that is left out of our models so far?

## The Appeal of Nash Equilibrium

The Nash equilibrium is based on the idea that every player's strategy should be the best response to the strategies of others.

::: {.incremental}

### Benefits of using NE:

  * In non-cooperative games, it makes sense that each player is making their best response to their opponent

    + If you can't enforce any strategy onto your opponent, you should stick with whatever doesn't make you worse off,
      given what your opponent chose.

    + In any situation which is not a Nash, there is some player who could have done better:

      - I.E., an NE leaves no-one with any *regrets*

:::

## Some Potential Critiques of NE predictions

::: {.incremental}

  * IESDS, Best-response functions may not be how players actually think

    + But NE only describe the *stable* combinations of strategies, 
      there are many ways of getting there: learning from experience, repeated play, intuition, etc.

:::

## Some Potential Critiques of NE predictions

::: {.incremental}

  * IESDS, Best-response functions may not be how players actually think

  * Nash doesn't explicitly take risk into account

    + with *ordinal* payoffs, we might leave out the incentive to play it safe to avoid very bad outcomes

    + but if we instead use *cardinal* payoffs, or expected utilities, we can still extend our models to those situations

## Some Potential Critiques of NE predictions

::: {.incremental}

  * IESDS, Best-response functions may not be how players actually think

  * Nash doesn't explicitly take risk into account

  * NE don't have to be *unique*

    + If we care *predictions*, NE doesn't always tell us what will happen,
      sometimes there can be multiple possible strategy profiles which are equally stable
      which means any one could happen depending how the game plays out

## Criticism 1: Treatment of Risk

We've mentioned before how sometimes the strategies played in NE don't line up with 
what might intuitively feel like the 'safe' strategies.

---

## Criticism 1: Treatment of Risk

Let's look an an example:

| Row, Column | A   | B   | C   |
|-------------+-----+-----+-----|
| **A**       | 2,2 | 3,1 | 0,2 |
| **B**       | 1,3 | 2,2 | 3,2 |
| **C**       | 2,0 | 2,3 | 2,2 |

> What's the NE?

## Criticism 1: Treatment of Risk

Let's look an an example:

| Row, Column | A                 | B          | C          |
|-------------+-------------------+------------+------------|
| **A**       | <u>2</u>,<u>2</u> | <u>3</u>,1 | 0,<u>2</u> |
| **B**       | 1,<u>3</u>        | 2,2        | <u>3</u>,2 |
| **C**       | <u>2</u>,0        | 2,<u>3</u> | 2,2        |

> What's the NE?

  * (**A**, **A**)

---

## Criticism 1: Treatment of Risk

| Row, Column | A   | B   | C   |
|-------------+-----+-----+-----|
| **A**       | 2,2 | 3,1 | 0,2 |
| **B**       | 1,3 | 2,2 | 3,2 |
| **C**       | 2,0 | 2,3 | 2,2 |

::: {.incremental}
  * But what happens if the other player mistakenly plays **C**?
  * Then it might make sense to choose the safe option of **C**
  * You could get the same payoff of 2, but ensure that you wouldn't have a chance to get 0

    + The idea of [trembling-hand perfection]{.hi} takes this into account by allowing probabilistic errors in strategies.

## Criticism 1: Treatment of Risk

What about this game?

| A, B     | Left   | Right      |
|----------+--------+------------|
| **Up**   | 9, 10  | 8, 9.9     |
| **Down** | 10, 10 | -1000, 9.9 |

::: {.incremental}
Let's suppose that there is a small probability $p$ that Player B will accidentally play Right
> What is Player A's expected utility of playing Up?

$$ EU_A(Up) = 9(1-p) + 8p $$

> What is Player A's expected utility of playing Down?

$$ EU_B(Down) = 10(1-p) - 1000p $$

So Player A should only play Down if:

$$
\begin{align}
10(1-p) - 1000p > & 9(1-p) + 8p \\
              p > & \frac{1}{1009}
\end{align}
$$

## Criticism 2: Multiple Equilibria

In some games, multiple Nash equilibria exist. This can create problems because:
- It’s unclear which equilibrium the players will choose.
- Some equilibria may not make sense in real-life situations.

### Example:

| Dante, Jose  | T4   | Metropol |
|--------------+------+----------|
| **T4**       | 2, 1 | 0, 0     |
| **Metropol** | 0, 0 | 1, 2     |

- In coordination games like **Battle of the Sexes**, there are multiple stable outcomes.

## Criticism 2: Multiple Equilibria

### Another Example

Pick one player to be [Boston]{.h}, one player as [San Francisco]{.h}

::::: {.incremental}
Here are 9 cities which must be evenly divided between the two players:
  
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
  * Atlanta
  * Chicago
  * Dallas
  * Denver
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
  * Los Angeles
  * New York
  * Philidelphia
  * Seattle
:::
::::

:::::

You win if you evenly split this list between you without communicating,
and without overlaps or missed cities

---

## Criticism 2: Multiple Equilibria

### Arriving at Specific NE

This last example shows the importance of shared background and culture in forming strategic beliefs
for cases with multiple NE

::: {.incremental}

  * So far, our theory have given us sets of NE which are stable given *any* set of realized beliefs

  * But it doesn't help us exaplain how those beliefs might be formed

  * [Evolutionary Game Theory]{.hi} adds tools to our basic toolkit to try to answer some of these limitations

:::

---

## Criticism 2: Multiple Equilibria

In the later chapters we will develop ideas to help narrow down the more general concept of NE

### Refinements to NE 

A [refinement]{.hi} is a restriction on the more general assumptions needed for Nash Equilibria

**Examples:**

  * [mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium]{.hi} allows for probabalistic plays
  * [subgame-perfect Nash equilibria]{.hi} aka *rollback equilibria* are refinements in *sequential games*
  * [perfect Bayesian equilibrium]{.hi} has to deal with informations asymmetries 

---

## Criticism 3: Requirements of Rationality

One major criticism is that Nash equilibrium assumes:

- Players have perfect knowledge of others' strategies.

- Players have rational preferences *and know that their opponent is rational*

### Counter-Argument:

- What are some situations you can think of where these assumptions might break down?

::: {.incremental}

  * Players might not know *who* they are playing against and what preferences they might have

  * Players might make *mistakes* and occasionally choose actions that don't fulfill their rational best response

:::

## Criticism 3: Requirements of Rationality

Consider this game:

| Row, Column | C1   | C2   | C3   |
|-------------+------+------+------|
| **R1**      | 0, 7 | 2, 5 | 7, 0 |
| **R2**      | 5, 2 | 3, 3 | 5, 2 |
| **R3**      | 7, 0 | 2, 5 | 0, 7 |

> What is the NE?

## Criticism 3: Requirements of Rationality

Consider this game:

| Row, Column | C1          | C2                 | C3          |
|-------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------|
| **R1**      | 0, <u>7</u> | 2, 5               | <u>7</u>, 0 |
| **R2**      | 5, 2        | <u>3</u>, <u>3</u> | 5, 2        |
| **R3**      | <u>7</u>, 0 | 2, 5               | 0, <u>7</u> |

> What is the NE?

::: {.incremental}

  * (R2, C2) is the only NE in this game

  * For this strategy profile, both players' beliefs about the other player's strategy are correct.

    + Column believes that Row will choose R2, so she chooses her best response of C2

    + Row believes that Column will choose C2, so he chooses his best response of R2

    + So in NE, each player's belief matches their opponent's best response

:::

---

## Criticism 3: Requirements of Rationality

| Row, Column | C1          | C2                 | C3          |
|-------------+-------------+--------------------+-------------|
| **R1**      | 0, <u>7</u> | 2, 5               | <u>7</u>, 0 |
| **R2**      | 5, 2        | <u>3</u>, <u>3</u> | 5, 2        |
| **R3**      | <u>7</u>, 0 | 2, 5               | 0, <u>7</u> |

But we could use similar logic for this game even when beliefs are *incorrect*

::: {.incremental}

  * We can justify Row playing **R1** if she believes that Column will play **C3**

  * Row could beleive this if she believes that *Column believes she is playing* **R3**

  * And if she also thinks that Column believes that she is playing **R3** 
    because Column believes that *Row believes that Column is playing* **C1**

## Rebuttal to Critics: Why Not Nash Equilibrium?

Game theorist Roger Myerson suggests:
- "Why not Nash equilibrium?" If someone proposes an alternative strategy profile, that profile must be evaluated.
- If it isn’t a Nash equilibrium, one of the players can improve by changing their strategy, disproving the alternative.

**Interactive Question:** How does this defense of Nash equilibrium answer critics' concerns?

---

## Alternative Concepts

Criticism has led to the development of alternative solution concepts, such as:
- **Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS)**: Strategies that persist over time through evolutionary pressure.
- **Correlated Equilibrium**: Players coordinate their strategies based on signals they receive from a common source.

### **Discussion Prompt:** Do you think alternatives like ESS or correlated equilibrium offer improvements over Nash equilibrium?

---

## Conclusion

While Nash equilibrium has clear limitations, it remains a central concept in game theory. Alternative solution concepts may provide better insights into certain situations, but Nash equilibrium is still the starting point for analyzing many strategic games.
