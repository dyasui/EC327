# Economics of Oligopoly

## Competition in the Restaurant Game

In the last example, we found Xavier and Yvonne's best responses independently of the other's.

  * But could they cooperate to raise prices more than in the NE?

If both charged $24, then they could each get 2,000 customers:

$$
Q = 44 - 2($24) + 24 = 20
$$

And each would earn a profit of $32,000

$$
\pi = (24 - 8)(20)
$$

which is more than the $28,000 they earned in NE

## Introduction to Oligopoly

In an oligopoly, a small number of firms (here just two) compete in the same market.

### Key Concepts:
- **Best-response curves**: Show how one firm’s best price depends on the other’s.
- **Equilibrium**: Each firm maximizes its profit, given the price set by the other firm.

**Question:** What do you think happens to prices when firms have fewer competitors?

## Best-Response Curves: Intuition

When one restaurant raises its price by $1:

::: {.incremental}

  - The other restaurant’s best response is to raise its own price by $0.25.

  - They lose some of their customers to their competitor who can reap some extra profit by raising their prices also
  (as long as they don't raise it higher than their competitor)

  - Thus by raising prices, one restaurant is providing a *positive externalitiy* to their competitor 
  which isn't priced into the NE profit function

## Allowing for cooperation in the Restaurant game

What if Xavier and Yvonne could coordinate their prices by setting them higher than equilibrium at $24?

::: {.incremental}
  * Xavier's best response function $P_X = 15 + 0.25 P_Y$ tells us that if he knows Yvonne is setting her price at $24,
  he should lower his price to $P_X = 21$ to attract more customers away from Yvonne
  * So there is always an incentive for either player to cheat the other at this cooperative strategy profile

## Allowing for cooperation in the Restaurant game

::: {.incremental}
Does this sound familiar?

  * This is a continuous version of the Prisoners' Dilemma we studied earlier:

    + Each player is incentivized to independently add to their payoff by harming the other

    + But if they could commit to coordinating, they could both be better off

## Optimal Oligopoly pricing in the Restaurant game

If Xavier and Yvonne could form a [cartel]{.hi} and jointly set prices for both their restaurants,
they should maximize the total payoff function:

$$
\begin{align}
\pi_X = \pi_Y & = (P - 8)(44 - 2P + P) \\
              & = -352 + 52P - P^2
\end{align}
$$

::: {.incremental}
  * Using the formula for the profit-maximizing price in this equation:
  * $P^* = 52/2 = 26$
  * The cartel should charge $26 and get $32,400 profit for each firm

## Why Does the Best-Response Curve Slope Upwards?

Each firm’s **best-response curve** slopes upwards because:

- When one firm raises its price, the other can raise its price slightly and still maintain some customers.

- This is a characteristic of oligopolies where price competition is less intense than in markets with many competitors.

## Types of Oligopoly: Cournot vs Bertrand

Our restaurant example had firms choosing *prices* to compete.

  * This type of competition is called [Bertrand competition]{.hi}

The other type of competition is where firms choose how much *quantity* to produce.

  * Otherwise known as [Cournot competition]{.hi}

---

## Application: Cournot Competition

::: {.incremental}

  * Let's see how we can use a game with continuous strategies to model a real-world situation.
  
  * In [Cournot competition]{.hi}, two firms produce the same product, and face the same market demand curve. The firms simultaneously decide how much product to produce, which they then sell at a price determined by that market demand curve.
  
  * This is a game with two players (the firms), and continuous strategies (the firms must pick a quantity to produce, which can be any non-negative real number).
  
  * In this example, we will use the following values:
  	+ Market Demand Curve: $Q = 100 - P$, in which $Q = q_1 + q_2$
  	+ Cost Functions: $c_i(q_i) = 10q_i$

## Cournot Competition: Creating the Payoff Functions
::: {.incremental}
  * First of all, we need payoff functions for each player.
  * Since the players are firms, and the goal of a firm is to maximize profit, we'll use the firms' profits as their payoffs.
  * We can construct the profit functions by taking TR - TC, or in this case, Pq - c(q).
  * Solving for P, we find that $P = 100 - Q = 100 - q_1 - q_2$.

## Cournot Competition: Creating the Payoff Functions
::: {.incremental}
This gives us:
$$
\begin{align}
\pi_1 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_1 - 10q_1 & \pi_2 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_2 - 10q_2\\
&= 100q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 - 10q_1 & &= 100q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2 - 10q_2\\
&= 90q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 & &= 90q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\pi_1 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_1 - 10q_1 & \pi_2 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_2 - 10q_2\\
&= 100q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 - 10q_1 & &= 100q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2 - 10q_2\\
&= 90q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 & &= 90q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2\\
&= (90 - q_2)q_1 - q_1^2 & &= (90 - q_1)q_2 - q_2^2
\end{align}
$$

## Cournot Competition: Finding Best-Response Functions
These best-response functions are in the by-now familiar quadratic form. Both of them have negative squared terms, so we can look for a maximum:
$$
\begin{align}
q_1 &= \frac{-(90 - q_2)}{2(-1)} & q_2 &= \frac{-(90 - q_1)}{2(-1)}\\
&= \frac{90 - q_2}{2} & &= \frac{90 - q_1}{2}\\
&= 45 - \frac{q_2}{2} & &= 45 - \frac{q_1}{2}
\end{align}
$$
---

## Cournot Oligopoly: Finding Nash Equilibrium

Solve these best-response rules as a system of equations:
$$
\begin{align}
q_1 &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}q_2\\
q_2 &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}q_1\\
\implies q_1 &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}(45 - \frac{1}{2}q_1) & q_2 &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}(30)\\
q_1 &= 45 - \frac{45}{2} + \frac{1}{4}q_1 & &= 45 - 15\\
\frac{3}{4}q_1 &= \frac{45}{2} & q_2^* &= \boxed{30}\\
q_1^* &= \boxed{30}
\end{align}
$$

## Another Cournot Example
> Crude oil is transported across the globe in enormous tanker ships called
> Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). By 2001, more than 92% of all new
> VLCCs were built in South Korea and Japan. Assume that the price of new
> VLCCs (in millions of dollars) is determined by the function $P = 180 - Q$,
> where $Q = q_{Korea} + q_{Japan}$. (That is, assume that only Japan and Korea
> produce VLCCs, so they are a duopoly.) Assume that the cost of building
> each ship is $30 million in both Korea and Japan. That is, $c_{Korea} = c_{Japan} = 30$,
> where the per-ship cost is measured in millions of dollars.

## Conclusion: The Economics of Oligopoly

In an oligopoly:

- Firms’ prices (quantities) are interdependent.

- The best-response functions allow us to determine equilibrium prices (or quantities in Bertrand).

## Interactive Exercise: Market Dynamics

Let’s extend this:

- **What happens when a third firm enters the market?**

  - Would prices fall? Would all three firms set similar prices?

  - Or would competition force one firm out of the market?
