# Applying Rationalizability

## Rationalizability

Recall the concept of [never a best response]{.hi} strategies.

All strategies which survive the eliminations of **NBR**'s 
are said to be [rationalizable]{.hi}.

## Applying Rationalizability

Remember this game from before?

| Row, Column | C1  | C2  | C3  |
|-------------+-----+-----+-----|
| **R1**      | 0,7 | 2,5 | 7,0 |
| **R2**      | 5,2 | 3,3 | 5,2 |
| **R3**      | 7,0 | 2,5 | 0,7 |

::: {.incremental}
  * We said that there is a unique NE (R2, C2) which could be justified with one set of beliefs
  * But also there was another chain of beliefs which could justify R1
  * That's because R1 is *rationalizable*
:::

## Applying Rationalizability

If we took away R2 and C2 from this game;

| Row, Column | C1  | C3  |
|-------------+-----+-----|
| **R1**      | 0,7 | 7,0 |
| **R3**      | 7,0 | 0,7 |

then you can see that there is no NE in pure strategies,

  * but all four strategy profiles are *rationalizable*

  * So *rationalizability* can still be useful even when NE cannot be found

## Applying Rationalizability to Continuous Games

There are two fishing boats in a small coastal town

  * they can catch as many fish as they want, but too many will flood the local market
  * the price of fish in the market is a function of how much each boat catches:

  $$ P = 60 - (R + S) $$

    + where $R$ and $S$ are barrels caught for each boat

  * Unit cost for each barrel is **30** ducats for boat $R$ 
    and **36** ducats for boat $S$

---

## Applying Rationalizability to Continuous Games

The profits of each boat are:

$$
\begin{align}
\pi_R = & [(60 - R - S) - 30] \cdot R = (30 - S)R - R^2\\
\pi_S = & [(60 - R - S) - 36] \cdot S = (24 - R)S - S^2
\end{align}
$$

> what are the best-response rules?

::: {.incremental}

$$ 
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta \pi_R}{\delta R} & = (30 - S) - 2R \\
\Rightarrow R^* = 15 - \frac{S}{2}
\end{align}
$$  

$$ 
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta \pi_S}{\delta S} & = (24 - S) - 2S \\
\Rightarrow S^* = 12 - \frac{R}{2}
\end{align}
$$

## Applying Rationalizability to Continuous Games

If you are the captian of boat $R$,

and you know that boat $S$'s best response rule is $S^* = 12 - \frac{R}{2},

> what values of $S$ should you plausibly expect them to ever pick?

::: {.incremental}

  * would they ever choose $S<0$?

  * what about $S>12$?

  * we can then say that only values $S \in [0,12]$ are *rationalizable*

  * What is $R$'s range of possible best-responses if $S \in [0,12]$?

    + $R^*(S = 0) = 15$, $R^*(S = 12) =  15 - 6 = 9$

:::

## Applying Rationalizability to Continuous Games

Now if you are the captian of boat $S$,

and you know that $R$ knows that you will only choose $S \in [0,12]$,

::: {.incremental}

  * What is $S$'s range of possible best-responses if $R \in [9,15]$?

    + $S^*(R = 9) = 12 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{15}{2}$, 
      $R^*(S = 15) =  12 - \frac{15}{2}  = \frac{9}{2}$

Iteratively applying this logic of eliminating ranges of non-rationalizable strategies
will converge on the unique NE:

  * ($R = 12$, $S = 6$)

  * this is also where the best-response rules intersect
