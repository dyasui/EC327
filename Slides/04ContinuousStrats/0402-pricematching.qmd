# Oligopoly

## Market Competition

Some definitions of competition:

  * [Monopoly]{.hi}: A single firm in a market

  * [Oligopoly]{.hi}: Only a few firms
    - [Duopoly]{.hii}: Two firms (like we've been looking at)
  
  * [Perfect Competition]{.hi}: Enough firms to guarantee zero-profit

---

## Monopoly Model

What would a single firm do in the market?

$$
\Pi = (p-10)(100-p)
$$

  * Here $p$ is the only price set by the monopolist

## Solving with Calculus

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Pi & = (p-10)(100-p) = 100p - p^2 - 1000 + 10p \\
      & = -p^2 + 110p - 1000
\end{align*}
$$

Find where the slope equals zero:
$$
\frac{\delta \Pi}{\delta p} = -2p + 110 + 0
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\delta \Pi}{\delta p} = 0 \\
  \Rightarrow  -2p + 110 & = 0 \\
  110 & = 2p \\
  p = \frac{110}{2} & = 55
\end{align*}
$$

## Comparing Monopoly to Bertrand

If a single firm:

  * Price = $55
  * Profit = $2,025

If two firms competing:

  * Price = $10
  * Profit = $0

## Price Matching Guarantees

> "Store Price Gurantee -- If you're about to buy at a Best Buy store and discover a lower price than ours, let us know and we'll match that price on the spot."

  * Does this seem like *competitive* behavior?

  * Compared to our earlier price competition model,
    
    - Will prices be higher

    - or lower in an equilibrium with price-matching?

---

## Price-matching Setup

Let's use the same costs and demand curve.

Two firms; shop 1 and shop 2 who both price match.

  * If $p_1\leq p_2$, then shop 1 will sell at $p_1$
  * but if $p_1 > p_2$, they agree to charge only $p_2$

---

## Price-matching Payoffs

Shop 1's payoff function:
$$
\begin{equation*}
  \Pi_1 = [\min\{p_1,p_2\}- 10][100 - \min\{p_1,p_2\}](\frac{1}{2})
\end{equation*}
$$
Shop 2's payoff function:
$$
\begin{equation*}
  \Pi_2 = [\min\{p_1,p_2\}- 10][100 - \min\{p_1,p_2\}](\frac{1}{2})
\end{equation*}
$$

## Price-Matching Nash

Consider both firms charging Monopolist's prices of $55:

Is this a Nash?

::: {.incremental}
  
  * If $p_1<55$:

    - $\Pi_1(p_1,55) = [p_1 - 10][100 - p_1](\frac{1}{2}) < 2025$

  * If $p_1>55$:

    - $\Pi_1(p_1,55) = [55- 10][100 - 55](\frac{1}{2}) 2025$

## Price-Matching Nash Outcome

With price-matching:

  * Both firms setting high prices ($55) is stable

  * Price-matching removes the incentives to undercut prices!

  * Could be used as a form of *legal collusion*
