# Evidence concerning Rollback

## Does rollback hold up in the real world?

One of the goals of game theory is to generate *testable predictions*

> You have all participated in a few such tests of the theory in this class

## Why didn't all teams find the rollback equilibrium?

:::{.incremental}

  * Did everyone have perfect information about the rules?

  * Were people thinking ahead?

  * Were there disagreements within any teams as to the optimal strategy?

## Why didn't all teams find the rollback equilibrium?

What about common knowledge of rationality?

:::{.incremental}

  * If you were on the second team to choose, and you see the first team doesn't take one flag, what should you think?

  * Should you still stick to the optimal strategy?

## Survivor Flag Results Discussion

This game was relatively simple because it only relied on *one team* to come up with the optimal strategy

::: {.incremental}

  * As long as the first team always took the right number of flags, 
  the second team didn't have any impact on the game

  * This is also a *zero-sum* game, so there were no opportunities for teams to benefit by cooperating

  * Let's look at a similar game, but with non-zero-sum payoffs

## Centipede Game

Two participants play this game, taking turns over several rounds.

The first is offered a choice between:

  a) splitting 50 cents where they keep 40 and the other player gets 10

  or b) they pass the choice to the next player who gets the same choice but the pot they can choose to split from doubles

## Centipede Game

First, what is the theoretical solution?

## Centipede Game

Now what would you do if you were in this situation?

When would you grab?

## Centipede Game

Out of 100 pairs of your peers, how many times do you think that player 1 would grab in the first node?

::: {.incremental}
  * In a lab experiment, only 2 times out of 281 did the first player take the first 40 cents (~1%)

How many times do you think player 2 grabed in the second node?

  * Only 18 out of 279 (~6%) did

How many pairs do you think got to the end of the tree without anyone grabbing?
So the last player giving up $12.80 for only $6.40

  * 15%!

## Centipede Game Evidence Discussion

What explains the drastic departure in lab experiments from the preditiction of backwards induction?

::: {.incremental}
  * Are players' not looking ahead to the end of the game?

    - Maybe? But in that experiment, the percentage of players grabbing increased over later stages. In the 5th node, 73% of player 1's grabbed.

  * Are college students driven by more than money?

    - Probably. What are some other things which could factor into these participants' payoffs?

    - What about how much they care about how much their opponent gets?

## Ultimatum Game

Player A and Player B are offered a dollar to divide amongst them.

  * Player A gets to propose how to split the dollar (i.e., 50:50, 75 to me 25 to you, etc)

  * Player B can either accept the proposed split, or reject so that both players get nothing

::: {.incremental}

> What is the rollback solution if both players payoffs are only determined by how much money they earn?

## Ultimatum Game Evidence

In spite of the theoretical prediction, the most common proposal in lab experiments is 50:50.

Most player B's actually reject any offer of 25% or less.

::: {.incremental}
  * This seems to indicate that most people have some sort of *aversion to inequity* 

  * If you're interested in learning more, **behavioral economics** develops on the basic rational agent model to make sense of some of these experimental findings

## A logical paradox with Backward induction

  * What should Jane do if Jon chose $b$?

  * If she knows Jon is rational, then he would choose $d$ if she chose $x$, and $c$ if she chose $y$

  * So Jane should choose $x$ to get a payoff of $5$ over $3$ if she chose $y$

  * But if Jon chose $b$, doesn't that mean that he can't be rational?

  * What should Jane do?

  * Maybe Jon just made a mistake, and Jane should stick to her assumption that he will continue to try to make rational choices
