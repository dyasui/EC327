## Lawmakers' Game ^[Dixit Chapter 3: question U4]

> Two distinct proposals, A and B, are being debated in Washington. Congress likes proposal A, and the president likes proposal B.

| Outcome | Congress | President |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| A becomes law | 4 | 1 |
| B becomes law | 1 | 4 |
| Both A and B become law | 3 | 3 |
| Neither (status quo prevails) | 2 | 2 |

## Lawmakers' Game ^[Dixit Chapter 3: question U4]

> The moves in the game are as follows. First, Congress decides whether to pass a bill and whether the bill is to contain A or B or both. Then the president decides whether to sign or veto the bill. Congress does not have enough votes to override a veto. Draw a tree for this game and find the rollback equilibrium.

## Lawmakers' Game ^[Dixit Chapter 3: question U4]

> Now suppose the rules of the game are changed in only one respect: the president is given the extra power of a line-item veto. Thus, if Congress passes a bill containing both A and B, the president may choose not only to sign or veto the bill as a whole, but also to veto just one of the two items. Show the new tree and find the rollback equilibrium.

## Preemption

> You're at the airport waiting to board your flight to go on vacation to Croatia with your carry-on backpack stuffed with everything you'll need so you don't have to pay for a checked bag.
> You look around and notice it seems like a lot of other people have had the same idea.
>
> A voice comes on the intercom with a familiar announcement: 
>
> *Due to this being a full flight, we will be asking passengers to check their bags at the gate*
>
> Even though boarding hasn't officially started yet, everyone is starting to stand around the ticket counter.

## Preemption

A [preemption game]{.hi} is one in which:

  1. players' payoff increase when they act before others

  2. but their payoffs are also higher when they act later in time

::: {.incremental}

  * You've probably noticed yourself playing a few different preemption games in different settings, even if you didn't have a name for it

## Preemption

A general lesson of all preemption games is that **players act too soon** from a social efficiency perspective.

::: {.incremental}
  * Everyone would be better off in the outcome where we all wait,
  but because there is an incentive to try to jump the line, 
  rational agents cannot be expected to wait instead of getting ahead

## War of Attrition

Not all games that involve waiting are *preemption games*, though.

::: {.incremental}
A [war of attrition]{.hi} is a type of game where:

  1. Players' payoffs are higher when they act *after* other players

  2. and higher the *sooner* in time they act

## War of Attrition

A general lesson of all premption games is that **players wait too long** than what would be socially efficient if they collectively acted sooner.

  * What if the players flipped a coin to decide who would act and then that player would immediately act?

  * What would be their *expected payoffs*

  * The problem is that such an agreement is *not enforcable*
    
    - Once the coin flip has been observed, there's nothing to stop the player who would be directed to act first to ignore the flip and wait.
