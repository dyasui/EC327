## Dixit Chapter 3: question U4

> The moves in the game are as follows. First, Congress decides whether to pass a bill and whether the bill is to contain A or B or both. Then the president decides whether to sign or veto the bill. Congress does not have enough votes to override a veto. Draw a tree for this game and find the rollback equilibrium.

## Dixit Chapter 3: question U4

> Now suppose the rules of the game are changed in only one respect: the president is given the extra power of a line-item veto. Thus, if Congress passes a bill containing both A and B, the president may choose not only to sign or veto the bill as a whole, but also to veto just one of the two items. Show the new tree and find the rollback equilibrium.
