# Welfare and Efficiency

::: incremental
What are the **good** outcomes in the planting game?

Can we rank outcomes by collective welfare?

## Pareto Dominance

Pareto optimality (or efficiency) is econonomists' best shot at coming up with a ranking of which outcomes are objectively 'better'

-   For any two outcomes (🎉, 🎊), 🎉 is [Pareto dominated]{.hi} by 🎊 if both:

    1.  No one strictly prefers 🎉 to 🎊 - U~👤~(🎊) $\geq$ U~👤~(🎉) $\forall 👤 \in \{ 🙍, 🧑, 💆, 🧖, 🧑, 😺, ...\}$

    2.  At least one person strictly~🎉~ prefers 🎉 to 🎊 - $\exists 👤$ such that U~👤~(🎊) $>$ U~👤~(🎉)

## Pareto Improvement

The move from a policy y to an alternative policy x is a [Pareto improvement]{.hi} if x Pareto dominates y.

-   Such a policy change should reasonably be seen as unambiguously good

-   Another perspective is that *no-one would veto* a pareto improvement

## Pareto Efficiency

An outcome is [Pareto Efficient]{.h} (Optimal) if no other outcome Pareto dominates it.

An outcome is [Pareto Infficient]{.hi} if at least one other outcome Pareto dominates it.

## Ranking the Planting Payoffs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](figures/fig3.6.png)

::: {.column width="50%"}
Compare (4,3,3) to (1,2,2)

-   Which one is Pareto dominating?

## Ranking the Planting Payoffs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](figures/fig3.6.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Now compare (4,3,3) to (3,4,3) or (3,3,4)

-   Which one is Pareto dominating?

Is the rollback equilibrium outcome a *Pareto efficient* one?

## Discussion: Efficiency vs other social comparisons

::: incremental
-   How useful is Pareto Efficiency in the real world?

  * How else could we group outcomes?
  
  * We might address this later in the class with what is known as 
    *Cooperative Game Theory*
