# Extensive Form

## Game Trees/Extensive Form as a tool

  * Before we learn how to solve a game, it will helpful to be able to visualize them

  * Because of the ordered nature of sequential games, a [tree diagram]{.hi} makes sense

---

## A *Decision* Tree

![](figures/decisiontree.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

::: notes
  - Is this a strategic decision? 
    - No: if it's only me 
  - Just because there are no other branches leading to the intiial node
  doesn't mean there are no other decisions that lead us here.
  Just that we are not modeling them for the sake of this decision.

## Extensive Form Definition

:::{.incremental}

A [Tree Graph]{.h} consists of:

  * Multiple [nodes]{.hi} with an ordered hierarchy starting from one [initial node]{.hii}

  * [Branches]{.hi} coming from each node which connect it to later nodes

  * The tree ends in any of the multiple [terminal nodes]{.hi}
:::

. . .
  
::: {.callout-warning}
Each (non-initial) terminal node may have multiple branches leading from it; 
but must only have *one* branch that *leads to it*.
:::

::: notes
  - This is because *actions* are different from *strategies*
    - even if the actions are practically similar, it matters how we got there
:::

---

## Anatomy of a tree

![](figures/tree-nodes.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

::: notes
  - There are three nodes in this tree,
    - one initial node at the top: this is where the game begins
    - two other nodes follow after the choice at the initial node is decided
:::

---

## Anatomy of a tree

![](figures/tree-branches.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

::: notes
  - In this case, each *decision node* has its own two *branches*
    - It helps to label each branch with the name of the action it represents
:::

---

## Anatomy of a tree

![](figures/tree-terminalnodes.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

::: notes
  - The game ends with four *terminal nodes* 
    - Unlike the nodes before, there is no decision to be made because the game is over
    - By convention, they won't be drawn as dots to differentiate them
:::

## Kidnapping Game ^[Harrington, pg 18]

A kidnapper named [Guy]{.hi} has contacted the victim's wife, named [Vivica]{.hi}, to demand a ransom.

To predict what will happen to the victim, [Orlando]{.hi}, we need to create a game theoretic model of the situation.

Let's use the language of the tree graph to visualize this game.

::: notes
  - Draw game on chalkboard step-by-step so students see how it's constructed
  - Explain order of each action for each node,
  starting w/ inital choice to kidnap or not

  * Who are the players?
  
  * Where are the decisions?
  
  * What are the branches? What do they represent?
  
  * What do the terminal nodes represent?
  
  * Is this a *complete* representation of a game? What's missing?
:::
::::

:::::

::: notes
  - Guy and Vivica are players because they have decisions which influence the outcome
  - Orlando is not a player
  - decisions are at each of the 4 nodes
  - Each action is a decision
  - A complete game needs preferences of the players!
  - Note that even though Guy has two branches each for Kill and Release,
  they show up in different parts of the tree.
    - Prior decisions matter!

## Kidnapping Game payoffs

| **Outcome**                                    | [**Guy**]{.red}   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| No kidnapping                                  | [3]{.red}         |
| Kidnapping, ransom paid, Orlando killed        | [4]{.red}         |
| Kidnapping, ransom paid, Orlando released      | [5]{.red}         |
| Kidnapping, no ransom paid, Orlando killed     | [2]{.red}         |
| Kidnapping, no ransom paid, Orlando released   | [1]{.red}         |

::: notes
  - Guy's preferences:
    - Best case: Gets ransom money and he doesn't have to kill Orlando
    - Next best: Gets money but he has to kill Orlando :(
    - Middle: No kidnapping, status quo, everyone goes about their lives
    - Next worst: Kidnaps Orlando, gets no ransom, but at least gets to play tough for next kidnapping victim
    - Worst case: Kidnaps Orlando but gets no ransom, *and* has to release Orlando

## Kidnapping Game payoffs

| **Outcome**                                    | [**Guy**]{.red}   | [**Vivica**]{.blue}   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| No kidnapping                                  | [3]{.red}         | [5]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, ransom paid, Orlando killed        | [4]{.red}         | [1]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, ransom paid, Orlando released      | [5]{.red}         | [3]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, no ransom paid, Orlando killed     | [2]{.red}         | [2]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, no ransom paid, Orlando released   | [1]{.red}         | [4]{.blue}            |

::: notes 
  - Vivica's preferences
    - Best case: She and Orlando get to go about their lives without experiencing kidnapping
    - Next best: Orlando is kidnapped, but is released without needing to pay
    - Middle: Orlando is kidnapped, but is released after ransom is paid
    - Next worst: Orlando is killed, but no ransom paid
    - Worst: Orlando is killed and loses money

## Kidnapping game tree with payoffs

![](figures/kidnapgame.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
  - We added the correct payoffs to the terminal node 
  corresponding to each outcome from the table

  - Note how the convention is that the first player to move has their 
  payoffs listed first

:::

## Predictions?

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](figures/kidnapgame.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Based on the extensive form game tree with payoffs,

- Do you have any predictions?
:::

::::

::: notes
  - Ask students what they would do in Guy's position,
  - in Vivica's?
  - Should they think about what the other player is thinking?
  - Would they have different preference orederings of the outcomes?

## a Definition of an Extensive Form Game: ^[for finite, perfect information games]

::: {.incremental}
  * A collection of decision-makers, called [players]{.hi} or *agents*
  
  * A set of [decision nodes]{.hi}, 
  each represents the *information* available to the player of that node
  
  * [Strategies]{.hi} for each player which list the **branches**
  from *each* node that represent the actions 
  a player would take if faced with that choice

    - We will use **actions** to refer to the individual branches.
  
  * A [tree diagram]{.h} which maps the intersections of players' strategy profiles
  to the outcomes represented at each [terminal node]{.hi}
:::

::: notes
  - connect this definition to the more general defition of a game from lecture 1
    - *players* are a part of every game
    - *decision nodes* are a specific representation of *information sets*
    - *strategies* will be defined by paths players take along the *branches*
    - *preferences* are represented by the payoffs at terminal nodes
:::

## Strategies in Extensive Form Games

:::: {.incremental}

::: {.callout-note}
## Definition
A [strategy]{.hi} is a **complete plan of action** 
which assigns an action at *every* node where a player makes a decision
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Be careful to distinguish between a [*strategy*]{.hi} and a single *action/choice*
:::

What's the difference?

::::

::: notes
  - The difference between a complete *strategy* and a single *action*
  is that a strategy contains a list of multiple actions 
  and the conditions for when that action will be taken
:::

---

## Apply this definition to the kidnapping game:

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="40%"}
![](figures/kidnapgame_blank.png){fig-align="center"}
::::


:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.incremental}

  * Is [*Do not kidnap*]{.red} a complete strategy for [Guy]{.red}?
  
  * No!

  * Why? Because it doesn't give us any *justification* for [Guy]{.red}'s action.

    - We don't know if this is rational (or even strategic)
:::
::::

:::::

::: notes
  - A complete strategy needs to include an action at every decision node

## Apply this definition to the kidnapping game:
::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="40%"}
![](figures/kidnapgame_blank.png){fig-align="center"}
::::


:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.incremental}

  * Write out at complete strategy for [Guy]{.red}
    - Let's give some shorter names for Guy's *actions*:
      + [$A$]{.red} $\equiv$ Kidnap Orlando (Abduct)
      + [$D$]{.red} $\equiv$ Don't kidnap Orlando
      + [$K$]{.red} $\equiv$ Kill Orlando 
      + [$L$]{.red} $\equiv$ Let Orlando live
:::
::::

:::::

::: notes
  - But Guy's choices depend on what Vivica chooses, 
  so his strategy is more complicated
:::
  
---

## Apply this definition to the kidnapping game:

Guy has $8$ total complete strategies:

| If Guy $A$bducts                          | If Guy $D$oesn't                              |
|-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ( [$A$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red} ) | ( [$D$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red} ) |
| ( [$A$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red} ) | ( [$D$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red} ) |
| ( [$A$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red} ) | ( [$D$]{.red}, [$K$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red} ) |
| ( [$A$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red} ) | ( [$D$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red}, [$L$]{.red} ) |

. . .

  * How do we know if any is more or less valid than the others?

::: {.notes}

  * It depends on Guy's *beliefs* about Vivica's behavior!
  * We need to think strategically
