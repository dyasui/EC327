## Solving Sequential Games

Now that we have defined all the parts of what a sequential game is 
we can start to *solve* them.

. . .

  - A solution in our case will be a prediction of what rational agents
  would do in a sequential game

## The smoking decision

Do I want to try smoking today? 

::: {.incremental}

> Suppose today I can either [Try]{.h} smoking for the first time, or [Not]{.h} try 

If I choose [Try]{.h} today, then I will have another choice in the *future*:

> [Continue]{.h} smoking, or [Quit]{.h}

:::

## The smoking decision

Let's create some preferences over the three different outcomes:

  - $U(\text{Not}) = 0$ - I'm no worse off, but don't get to experience what it's like

  - $U(\text{Try}\rightarrow\textbf{Quit}) = 1$ - I get the experience of smoking without long-term health consequences, etc.

  - $U(\text{Try}\rightarrow\textbf{Continue}) = -1$ - I become an addict

## The smoking decision

Let's model this as a *decision tree*

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}

  * What would a *rational* version of myself choose?

  * Is this realistic?

  * Why might Trying and then Quitting be a bad idea?

:::
::::

## The smoking *game*

We can apply the tools of game theory to this decision:

::: {.incremental}
  * Let's add *future Dante* as another player who acts at the second decision node

  * Future Dante is different from *Present Dante* because he has different preferences:

    - $U_{FD}(\text{Continue}) = 1$ because he's already addicted

    - $U_{FD}(\text{Quit}) = -1$ because withdrawl is painful

  * What will Future Carmen choose?

  * Should Carmen choose to Try smoking *if she knows what her future self would choose?*

:::
::::

:::::

## 'Pruning' branches

If Carmen is *forward looking*, knows her *future self's preferences*, and knows that her future self is *rational*,

Then she can eliminate the possibility that her future self would quit.

::: {.incremental}

  * [Pruning]{.hi} is this type of logic applied to eliminating certain branches in a game tree.
:::

---

## 'Pruning' branches

If Future Carmen will never choose to Quit smoking once she is already an addict, 

> what choices is **Today's Carmen** left with?

::: {.incremental}
  
  * [Try]{.h} knowing that she will continue in the future and get -1 payoff

  * or [Not]{.h} try smoking today and earn 0 payoff

:::

---

## Backwards Induction (intuitively)

Let's outline the logical steps we used to solve this game:

::: {.incremental}

  * We were uncertain about what would happen in this game, because **Today's Carmen**'s optimal strategy depended on what **Future Carmen** woud do

  * But **Future Carmen** is the last player in this game, so her choice only depends on her *own preferences*

  * Knowing what **Future Carmen** would choose allowed us to find **Today's Carmen**'s best strategy

::: notes
  - Either crossing off eliminated branches or highlighting chosen branches works
  - Just make sure that the order of thinking is clear

## Backwards Induction defined

The method of looking at decisions in the future to decide what to do now is called [Backwards Induction]{.h} or [Rollback]{.h}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Definition ^[Dixit et al, pg 56]
... using [rollback]{.h} requires starting to think about what will happen at all the terminal nodes and literally "rolling back" through the tree to the initial node...
:::

---

## Backwards Induction defined

The method of looking at decisions in the future to decide what to do now is called [Backwards Induction]{.h} or [Rollback]{.h}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Definition ^[Dixit et al, pg 56]
When all players do *rollback analysis* to choose their optimal strategies, we call this set of strategies the [*rollback equilibrium*]{.h}^[aka subgame perfect equilibrium] of the game; the outcome that arises from playing these strategies is the [*rollback equilibrium outcome*]{.hi}

## Solving the Kidnapping Game

![](figures/kidnapgame.png)

::: notes
  - If Vivica paid ransom, Guy would rather Release
  - If Vivica didn't pay, Guy would rather Kill
  - Knowing this, Vivica would Pay to avoid Orland being killed
  - Therefore, Guy should kidnap Orlando knowing that Vivica will pay and he can release Orlando
:::

---

## Kidnapping Game Solution

The [Rollback Equilibrium]{.h} is:

  * **{** ([Kidnap]{.red}, [Release]{.red}, [Kill]{.red}), ([Pay]{.blue}) **}**

::: {.incremental}
You should read this as:

  - Guy [Kidnaps]{.red} and will [Release]{.red} if Vivica [Pays]{.blue}, but will [Kill]{.red} if Vivica [Doesn't Pay]{.blue}

  - Vivica [Pays]{.blue} the ransom

# Adding more players

## 3-player planting game

::: {.incremental}
  * [Emily]{.hi}, [Nina]{.hi}, and [Talia]{.hi} are roommates who want to get a start on their communal garden. 
  
  * They like to enjoy the benefits of fresh produce and green space, but it is costly for them to put the work in.
  
  * **2 or 3 people** working is enough to keep the garden healthy, but if **1 or 0** work, then the garden will die.

| I contribute, and get garden.        | 3       |

Which of Talia's strategies can be eliminated as *irrational*?

## Rollback in the Planting Game

Let's simplify the game by pruning Talia's eliminated branches

![](figures/plantinggame.png)

::: notes
  - Draw new tree on board with only Emily and Nina's branches, 
      - replace Talia's decision nodes with new terminal nodes with payoffs corresponding to non-pruned end branches

## Equilibrium Path of Play

::: {.incremental}

Note that there is one continuous path we traced from the initial node to a final equilibrium outcome.

However, we couldn't have gotten their without the other arrows paths **even though they are never reached** in equilibrium.

Recall that a [strategy]{.hi} is a collection of choices at **every** decision node.

:::

---

## Equilibrium Strategies

Even though the players available actions are all called the same (Contribute or Don't), this tree provides labels of each decision node so we can say something like:

  > "Nina's **strategy** in the rollback equilibrium is \{ [*Don't Contribute*]{.hii} at [b]{.hi}, [*Contribute*]{.hii} at [c]{.hi} \}".
  
  * To make it even shorter, let's call this strategy [DC]{.hii}.
  
---

  
## Rollback Equilibrium Strategies

The equilibrium is:

  * \{ [D]{.hi}^[Emily], [DC]{.hi}^[Nina], [DCCD]{.hi}^[Talia]  \} 
  
---

## Three new concepts

  1. A list of *available strategies* for each player ^[could be very long]

  2. An *optimal strategy* for each player

     - A complete plan of action states a player's best choice at each node where she *could* make a decision ^[even if never reached in equilibrium]
  
  3. The path of play in [rollback equilibrium]{.hi} which combines optimal strategies for all players
