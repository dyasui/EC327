## Backwards Induction defined

The method of looking at decisions in the future to decide what to do now is called [Backwards Induction]{.h} or [Rollback]{.h}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Definition ^[Dixit et al, pg 56]
When all players do *rollback analysis* to choose their optimal strategies, we call this set of strategies the [*rollback equilibrium*]{.h}^[aka subgame perfect equilibrium] of the game; the outcome that arises from playing these strategies is the [*rollback equilibrium outcome*]{.hi}

## Group Exercise:

Consider the Flag game but instead of starting with 21 flags the game starts with 5
flags, and instead of being able to pick 1,2, or 3 flags teams can only pick 1 or 2
flags.

1. _Draw the extensive form game tree complete with all payoff for both teams._

2. _How many total strategies are there for team 1?_

3. _Use pruning to eliminate actions to get to a rollback equilibrium. Who will win? What is the winning strategy?_

## Adding more players

We can start to add more complexity with more than two players

## 3-player planting game

::: {.incremental}
  * [Emily]{.hi}, [Nina]{.hi}, and [Talia]{.hi} are roommates who want to get a start on their communal garden. 
  
  * They like to enjoy the benefits of fresh produce and green space, but it is costly for them to put the work in.
  
  * **2 or 3 people** working is enough to keep the garden healthy, but if **1 or 0** work, then the garden will die.

## Planting Game payoffs

| outcome:                             | utlity: |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
| I don't contribute, but garden lives | 4       |
| I contribute, and get garden.        | 3       |
| I don't contribute, and garden dies  | 2       |
| I contribute, but garden dies        | 1       |

## Equilibrium Path of Play

::: {.incremental}

Note that there is one continuous path we traced from the initial node to a final equilibrium outcome.

However, we couldn't have gotten their without the other arrows paths **even though they are never reached** in equilibrium.

Recall that a [strategy]{.hi} is a collection of choices at **every** decision node.

## Equilibrium Strategies

Even though the players available actions are all called the same (Contribute or Don't), this tree provides labels of each decision node so we can say something like:

  > "Nina's **strategy** in the rollback equilibrium is \{ [*Don't Contribute*]{.hii} at [b]{.hi}, [*Contribute*]{.hii} at [c]{.hi} \}".
  
  * To make it even shorter, let's call this strategy [DC]{.hii}.

## How many strategies does Talia have?
  
::: {.incremental}

  * CCCC, CCCD, CCDC, CCDD, CDCC, CDCD, CDDC, CDDD, DCCC, DCCD, DCDC, DCDD, DDCC, DDCD, DDDC, DDDD

* 16 total strategies

:::

## Rollback Equilibrium Strategies

The equilibrium is:

  * \{ [D]{.hi}^[Emily], [DC]{.hi}^[Nina], [DCCD]{.hi}^[Talia]  \}

## Tic-Tac-Toe

  * Even though it looks complicated, the main branches are really just copies of each other

  * Most people probably figure out the rollback equilibrium after playing it enough

## Chess

  * What about more complicated games like chess?
  
    + technically rollback solvable, but with $10^{120}$ possible moves, it hasn't been solved by either human or machine
    
  * Players of complicated sequential games often implement some [intermediate valuation function]{.hi} to assign payoffs to non-terminal nodes.
