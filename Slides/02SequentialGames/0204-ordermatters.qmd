## First-mover advantage

Emily received her best outcome of 4 because she can take advantage of acting first.

::: {.incremental}

  * When a game favors those who act first, we say there is a [first-mover advantage]{.hi}

  * But it's not always helpful to act first!

:::

## Second-mover advantage

Sometimes you want to see the actions of others before you know your best response

::: {.incremental}

  * When a game favors those who decide after another player, there is a [second-mover advantage]{.hi}

  * For example, [Squid Game bridge](https://youtu.be/Kyjms3DLXAE) game

This is just for a simpler game with a 2x2 grid.

  * Even though it looks complicated, the main branches are really just copies of each other

  * What is the rollback equilibrium?

## 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe

  * Most people probably figure out the rollback equilibrium after playing it enough
  
::: {.incremental}
  * The second player can always get at least a tie:

    - If first player chooses middle, then take a corner

    - If first player chose anything else, take the middle

    - After the first stages, block any attempt by player 1 to get 3 in a row

## More complicated games

Do all games have theoretical solutions?

::: {.incremental}
  * Checkers?

  * Chess?

  * Go?
:::

## Chess

::: {.incremental}
  * Technically rollback solvable, but with $10^{120}$ possible moves, it hasn't been solved by either human or machine
    
  * Human experts and computer programs instead rely on *experience* of past game possibilities

  * and on some partial rollback, or an [intermediate valuation function]{.hi}, where you look at all possibilities in the next few moves and assign probabilistic payoffs

:::

## Theory in complicated situations

Is rollback still useful for complicated games where the theoretical solutions are infeasible to solve?

::: {.incremental}

>Yes!

  * Understanding simpler games can help you develop intuition for solving more complicated ones

  * Complicated games can be decomposed into smaller parts where solving is easier
