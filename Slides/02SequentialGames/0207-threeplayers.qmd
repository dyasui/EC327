# Adding more players

## 3-player planting game

From the textbook:

::: {.incremental}
  * [Emily]{.hi}, [Nina]{.hi}, and [Talia]{.hi} are roommates who want to get a start on their communal garden. 
  
  * They like to enjoy the benefits of fresh produce and green space, but it is costly for them to put the work in.
  
  * **2 or 3 people** working is enough to keep the garden healthy, but if **1 or 0** work, then the garden will die.

| outcome:                             | utlity: |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
| I don't contribute, but garden lives | 4       |
| I contribute, and get garden.        | 3       |
| I don't contribute, and garden dies  | 2       |
| I contribute, but garden dies        | 1       |

Who should we start with to solve this game?

  * Talia, because she is the last one to move, her choices don't depend on other players

Which of Talia's strategies can be eliminated as *irrational*?

  * Any which include an action which would lead to a lower payoff than another possible action at the same node

## Rollback in the Planting Game

Let's simplify the game by pruning Talia's eliminated branches

![](figures/plantinggame.png)

::: notes
  - Draw new tree on board with only Emily and Nina's branches, 
      - replace Talia's decision nodes with new terminal nodes with payoffs corresponding to non-pruned end branches

## Equilibrium Path of Play

::: {.incremental}

Note that there is one continuous path we traced from the initial node to a final equilibrium outcome.

However, we couldn't have gotten their without the other arrows paths **even though they are never reached** in equilibrium.

Recall that a [strategy]{.hi} is a collection of choices at **every** decision node.

## Equilibrium Strategies

Even though the players available actions are all called the same (Contribute or Don't), this tree provides labels of each decision node so we can say something like:

  > "Nina's **strategy** in the rollback equilibrium is \{ [*Don't Contribute*]{.hii} at [b]{.hi}, [*Contribute*]{.hii} at [c]{.hi} \}".
  
  * To make it even shorter, let's call this strategy [DC]{.hii}.
  
---

  
## Rollback Equilibrium Strategies

The equilibrium is:

  * \{ [D]{.hi}^[Emily], [DC]{.hi}^[Nina], [DCCD]{.hi}^[Talia]  \}
