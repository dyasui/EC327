\begin{frame}{Information Sets}
    \textbf{Recall}: 
    from our extensive form game definition
    that each \emph{node} represented the 
    \alert{information} available to the player 
    \pause 
    In general;
    \begin{itemize}
        \item an \alert{information set} 
            contains \emph{all} decision nodes that a player can tell apart.
    \pause
        \item An information set can contain multiple nodes; 
            in which case the player cannot determine between which branches have lead to this info set.
    \pause
        \item Each decision node can only blong to \emph{one} info set at a time.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Before Guy could see whether ransom was paid;
            now he has to choose to kill or release without knowing
        \item Nodes $N_3$ and $N_4$are now part of the same \alert{information set};
            represented by the dotted box around them
