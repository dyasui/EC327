# Best-Response Analysis

## Limits of IESDS

Not every game is [dominance solvable]{.hi} through IESDS.

Can we still find NE in those games?

::: {.incremental}

  * Yes! We just need to remember the *best-responding* part of our definition of NE

:::

## Best-Responding
::: {.incremental}
- In finding Nash equilibrium, **best-response analysis** is key.
- Each player chooses their best action in response to the strategies of others.
- This iterative process helps in solving games with many possible strategies.
:::

---

## Best Responses
::: {.incremental}
  * If you know other player's strategy, then you can respond accordingly
  * Even if you don't know, forming a *belief* helps you solve the game
:::

## Best Response Definition
Strategy $s_i$ is a [best response]{.hi} to $s_{-i}$ if and only if it provides the highest payoff possible when the other player chooses $s_{-i}$.

  - The best response correspondence $b_i(s_{-i})$ is the strategy or set of strategies that give the highest payoff against $s_{-i}$
:::

## Some Notes on Best Responses
::: {.incremental}
  * "to another player's strategy" is **important**.
  * A strategy can only be a best response **to some strategy of the other player**. 
    - No such thing as a universally best response (that's a dominant strategy)
  * There is always at least one best response to another player's strategy
    - And there may be multiple best responses to another players strategy
:::
---

## Best Responses in Practice

Marking best responses in normal form:

::: {.incremental}
  * Go through each strategy in the game of one player (row or column)
    - Mark the best option of the *responding player*
    - Okay to mark the payoffs, but keep in mind they are not same as the *strategies*
  * Don't try to describe the best response using the payoff.
    - A best response is a *strategy*

## Best Response Analysis

Let's revisit this game from the beginning of the lecture:

| Row, Column | Left | Middle | Right |
|-------------+------+--------+-------|
| **Top**     | 3, 1 | 2, 3   | 10, 2 |
| **High**    | 4, 5 | 3, 0   | 6, 4  |
| **Low**     | 2, 2 | 5, 4   | 12, 3 |
| **Bottom**  | 5, 6 | 4, 5   | 9, 7  |

  * We'll break down the best responses one step at a time

## Best Response Analysis

Suppose you're the Row player:

| Row        | Left |
|------------+------|
| **Top**    | 3    |
| **High**   | 4    |
| **Low**    | 2    |
| **Bottom** | 5    |

What would you do if you *knew* Column will play **Left**?

## Best Response Analysis

| Row        | Left     |
|------------+----------|
| **Top**    | 3        |
| **High**   | 4        |
| **Low**    | 2        |
| **Bottom** | <u>5</u> |

We'll underline this payoff as **Bottom** is the [best response]{.hi} to **Left**

| Row        | Left     | Middle   |

| **Bottom** | <u>5</u> | 4        | 9         |

And **Low** is also the [best response]{.hi} to **Right**

The NE of this game is where the best responses intersect:

  * (**Low**, **Middle**)

. . .

  * This results in a payoff of 5 to Row, 4 to Column

## Nash Equilibrium from Best Responses

Recall the various definitions of a Nash Equilibrium:

::: {.incremental}

  * no-one can improve their payoff by changing *only their own strategy*.

  * Each player has *no regrets* about their strategy.

  * [Everyone's strategy is a best responses to everyone else's]{.h}
