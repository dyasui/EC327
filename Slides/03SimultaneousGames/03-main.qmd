# Evidence for Sequential Rationality

## Centipede Game

Two participants play this game, taking turns over five rounds.

The first is offered a choice between:

  a) splitting 50 cents where they keep 40 and the other player gets 10

  or b) they pass the choice to the next player who gets the same choice but the pot they can choose to split from doubles

Now what would you do if you were in this situation?

When would you grab?

## Centipede Game

What is the theoretical solution?

## Ultimatum Game

Player A and Player B are offered a dollar to divide amongst them.

  * Player A gets to propose how to split the dollar (i.e., 50:50, 75 to me 25 to you, etc)

  * Player B can either accept the proposed split, or reject so that both players get nothing

> What is the rollback solution if both players payoffs are only determined by how much money they earn?

## Ultimatum Game Evidence

In spite of the theoretical prediction, the most common proposal in lab experiments is 50:50.

Most player B's actually reject any offer of 25% or less.

  * This seems to indicate that most people have some sort of *aversion to inequity* 

  * If you're interested in learning more, **behavioral economics** develops on the basic rational agent model to make sense of some of these experimental findings
