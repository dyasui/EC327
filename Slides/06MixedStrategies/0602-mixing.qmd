## Internal Uncertainty

::: {.incremental}
  * Now that we discussed *external uncertainty* over *states of nature*,
  let's talk about [internal uncertainty]{.hi}

	* Internal uncertainty occurs when one or more players pick their strategies randomly.

	* Picking a strategy at random is really just a different kind of strategy, called a [mixed strategy]{.hi}.
:::
---

## Mixed Strategies

When a player always does the same thing, it's called a [pure strategy]{.hi}
  
A [mixed strategy]{.hi} assigns a probability to each of a player's pure strategies. 

::: {.incremental}
  * Like a lottery, the probabilities in a mixed strategy must all be between 0 and 1,
  * and must sum to exactly 1.
:::
---

## Mixed Strategies

::: {.incremental}
  * A mixed strategy can assign 0 probability to a pure strategy.
  * It can even assign probability 1 to a single pure strategy, and probability 0 to all others
    + this is still, technically, a mixed strategy, but it is a trivial one.
	* When a player uses a mixed strategy, it turns the **other** player's payoffs into lotteries.

## Mixed Strategies in the Deer Hunt

Consider the Deer Hunt:

| Igg, Ogg | Deer | Rabbit |
|----------+--------+----------|
| Deer     | $2, 2$ | $0, 1$   |
| Rabbit   | $1, 0$ | $1, 1$   |

Suppose that Igg hunts Deer 3/4 of the time, and Rabbit 1/4 of the time.

::: {.incremental}
  * If Ogg *always hunts deer*; 
  what is Ogg's *expected payoff*?
	* Ogg's expected payoff from playing Deer will be $0.75(2) + 0.25(0) = 1.5$.
:::
---

## Mixed Strategies in the Deer Hunt: Generalizing

We can generalize this approach to calculate Ogg's expected payoffs from any strategy that Igg chooses to play:

::: {.incremental}
  * Suppose that Igg plays Deer with probability p, and Rabbit with probability 1 - p.
  * Then Ogg's expected payoff from Deer is:
    + $2(p) + 0(1 - p) = 2p$, and from Rabbit, it is $1(p) + 1(1 - p) = 1$.
  * Note that Ogg's expected payoff from Deer gets larger with p: the more
  likely Igg is to hunt Deer, the more attractive an option it becomes for Ogg.
:::
---

## When to Play a Mixed Strategy?

It's possible for a mixed strategy to be a best response to the other player's strategy:

  * if and only if all of the mixed strategy's [components]{.hi} (pure strategies that are assigned positive probability) are best responses too.
  * Some intuition: If a strategy is not a best response, you should not play it---even as part of a mixed strategy.

---

## When to play a Mixed Strategy?

If a player only has **two pure strategies**, it becomes simple to tell when a mixed strategy is a best response: the mixed strategy must be a mixture of those two pure strategies, and the only way that both of them are best responses is if they have equal expected payoffs.

::: {.incremental}
  * Taking the Deer Hunt as an example, the only way that it can be a best
  response for Ogg to play a mixed strategy is if Deer and Rabbit provide Ogg
  with equal expected payoffs: we must have $2p = 1$, or $p = \frac{1}{2}$.
:::
---

## What Mixed Strategy to Play
::: {.incremental}
  * However, if any mixed strategy is a best response, then **all** mixed
  strategies (with the same components) are also best responses.
  * Intuitively, if the pure strategies going into a mixed strategy are just as
  good as each other, then it doesn't matter what proportions you mix them in.
  * This means that, while it's easy to solve for **when** it's rational for a
  player to use a mixed strategy, there's no way to solve for a particular
  mixed strategy that the player **should** play.
:::
---

## Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium

To solve for the Nash equilibria where players are allowed to use mixed strategies:
we need to look for the conditions under which a player would be willing to use a mixed strategy.

::: {.incremental}
  * This means that we're going to use one player's expected payoffs to solve for the **other** player's mixed strategy
:::
---

## MSNE in the Deer Hunt
Let's say that Igg plays Deer with probability $p$ and Rabbit with probability $1 - p$

While Ogg plays Deer with probability $q$ and Rabbit with probability $1 - q$.

::: {.incremental}
 * This is simply a framework for describing each player's mixed strategies:
   we're using placeholder variables for the players' mixed strategy probabilities
:::
---

## MSNE in the Deer Hunt
We already saw that Ogg's expected payoffs from Deer and Rabbit are $2p$ and $1$, respectively, 

so Ogg would only play a mixed strategy if $p = \frac{1}{2}$.

::: {.incremental}
  * Likewise, Igg's expected payoffs are $2q$ and $1$, and Igg will play a mixed strategy if $q = \frac{1}{2}$.
  * The MSNE in this game can be written as:
  $$ \{(1/2~Deer, 1/2~Rabbit)_{Ogg}, \ (1/2~Deer, 1/2~Rabbit)_{Igg}\}$$.
:::
---

## Error-Checking

Make sure that you're setting up the equations used to solve for a player's strategy correctly:

::: {.incremental}
  * Describe when a player is *indifferent* between their pure strategies: 
    + if you're trying to figure out when **Player 1** is indifferent, you need to use **Player 1's** payoffs.
  * However, the probabilities will be based on the **other** player's mixed strategy: 
    + in a game with mixed strategies, the randomness a player deals with is created by the **other** player---not themselves.
:::

## Absence of MSNEs {.smaller}

Guido and Luca's expected payoffs are:

::: {.incremental}
  * $U_G(Testify) = -10q + 0(1 - q) = -10q$.
  * $U_G(Keep Quiet) = -20q + (-1)(1 - q) = -1 - 19q$.
  * $U_L(Testify) = -10p + 0(1 - p) = -10p$.
  * $U_L(Keep Quiet) = -20p + (-1)(1 - p) = -1 - 19p$.
:::

## Absence of MSNEs {.smaller}
Guido will play a mixed strategy if:

$$
\begin{align*}
-10q &= -1 - 19q\\
9q &= -1\\
q &= -1/9
\end{align*}
$$

::: {.incremental}
  * But **-1/9 is not a valid probability!**
  * We could also note that if $q\in [0, 1]$:
    + $-10q$ is always greater than $-1 - 19q$.
