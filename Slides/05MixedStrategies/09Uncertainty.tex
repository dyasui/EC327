	\item A lottery doesn't have to only be about money
  \item For any set of outcomes in a lottery, there will be an associated probability: if $a$ is a possible outcome, then $P(a)$ is the probability that it occurs.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All probabilities must be between 0 and 1: $0 \leq P(a) \leq 1$ for all possibilities $a$.
		\item Additionally, the probabilities given in a particular lottery must sum to exactly 1: we will assume that one, and exactly one, outcome must actually occur.

\item Doc's payoff from strategy profile ($Stay,~Match$) is a lottery in which he gains 1 with probability 0.5, and loses 1 with probability 0.5.
\item Wyatt's payoff from the same strategy profile is a lottery in which he loses 1 with probability 0.5, and gains 1 with probability 0.5.
\item the expected payoffs of these lotteries are both 0.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the left-hand subgame (after Doc Stays), Wyatt has the choice between $1 - 2p$ and $-1$. Indifference implies that $1 - 2p = -1$, or $p = 1$. Wyatt is only indifferent here if Doc is guaranteed to have the better hand; if $p < 1$, Wyatt will simply prefer to Match.
		\item In the right-hand subgame (after Doc Raises), $2 - 4p = -1$ implies $p = \frac{3}{4}$. If $p < \frac{3}{4}$, Wyatt will prefer to Match; if $p > \frac{3}{4}$, Wyatt will prefer to Quit.

	\item Now let's consider Doc's decisions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If Wyatt plays (Match, Match), implying that $p \leq \frac{3}{4}$, Doc's choice is between $2p-1$ and $4p-2$. Doc is indifferent when $p = \frac{1}{2}$; when p is smaller, he prefers to Stay, and when p is larger, he prefers to Raise.
		\item If Wyatt plays (Match, Quit), implying that $\frac{3}{4} \leq p \leq 1$, Doc's choice is between $2p - 1$ and $1$. Doc is indifferent if $p = 1$; for $\frac{3}{4} \leq p < 1$, Doc prefers to Raise.
		\item If Wyatt plays (Quit, Quit), which he would only do if $p = 1$ exactly, Doc's choice is between $-1$ and $-1$: not really a choice at all. Doc is completely indifferent here.

\frametitle{Summary of SPNE in Sequential-Move Card Game}
\begin{itemize}
\item We can summarize all of the possible SPNEs as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \{Stay, (Match, Match)\} is an SPNE if $0 \leq p \leq \frac{1}{2}$.
\item \{Raise, (Match, Match)\} is an SPNE if $\frac{1}{2} \leq p \leq \frac{3}{4}$.
\item \{Raise, (Match, Quit)\} is an SPNE if $\frac{3}{4} \leq p \leq 1$.
\item \{Stay, (Match, Quit)\}, \{Stay, (Quit, Quit)\}, and \{Raise, (Quit, Quit)\} are all SPNEs if $p = 1$.
