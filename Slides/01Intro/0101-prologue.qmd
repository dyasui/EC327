### Theory in a data-driven world?

  > "The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions
immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an
apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking which helps its possessor to draw
correct conclusions." â€” Keynes

### What are the limits to theory?

::: {.incremental}
  * Our models will never be perfect representations of reality
  * But we should know how well they *approximate* the parts of the world we want to understand
  * Theory is very useful for generating *falsifiable hypotheses*, which we can then use to guide experimental or statistical tests
  * As we play games in class, we will observe the data and compare to our theoretical predictions
