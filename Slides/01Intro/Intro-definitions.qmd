# What is a Game? Definitions

## Examples of some questions:
:::{.incremental}
  * Why does Best-buy offer price match guarantee?
  * Why are there 4 different [iPhone 15](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201296)'s?!
  * Does adding more highway lanes really result in shorter commute times?
  * Why did the US and USSR adopt Mutually Assured Destruction?
  * Why do people give engagement rings?
:::

## What do all these questions have in common?
::: {.incremental}
  * They all involve people making choices which depend on the choices of others
  * In other words, they are questions of [strategy]{.hi}:

    > **Strategic interdependence** is present in a social situation when what is best for someone *depends* on what someone else does. ^[*Harrington*, pg. 2]

  * In the rest of this lecture, we will build up this definition formally
    - but why is that necessary?

## A definition of a game ^[adapted from [Leigh Tesfatsion](https://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/)'s slides]

A **Game** consists of:

  * a collection of decision-makers, called [players]{.hi};
  * the set of [information]{.hi} available to each player;
  * the [strategies]{.hi} available to each player in each information state;
  * a mapping from the intersection strategies of all players to outcomes;
  * [preferences]{.hi} of the individual players over all possible outcomes

# Who are the players?

## What defines a player?
 * [Preferences]{.h}: 
   Everyone has certain things they *want*.

   But you usually can't get everything you want; 
   economics is all about *constrained choices*.

    So its important to have priorities
    and to understand which things people prefer to others.

 * [Information]{.h}:
   Some people might be better informed than others.
   
 * [Beliefs]{.h}:
   What do I think about when I have to make a strategic choice?

## Preferences

[Preferences]{.h} describe the subjective ranking that we put on different alternatives.

For example, on the set of Eugene boba stores, my preference ranking goes like this;

::: {.incremental}
  1. [Day & Night](https://www.daynightboba.com/) - they have mango sago, cute location
  2. [Tea 4](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zCVTUnaaYLD1Rwaw6) - major chain, good quality and selection
  3. [Bobahead]() - no more campus location 😔
  4. No boba
  5. [Rabbit Hole](http://therabbitholeteabar.com/) - no hate, just not for me
:::

## Rational Preferences

The [rational model]{.h} of choice is the foundation of all economics.

Its assumptions are that:

::: {.incremental}

  * People have [complete preferences]{.h}
    - for *every* pair of options, you can either tell me which you prefer or that you are *indifferent*
    - for any pair of deserts, $\{ \ 🍨 \ , \ 🍩 \ \}$, either $(🍨 \succ 🍩 \ )$, or $(🍩 \ \succ 🍨 \ )$, or $(🍨 \sim 🍩 \ )$

  * Preferences are [transitive]{.h}
    - if $(☕ \succ 🍵 \ )$ and $(🍵 \succ 🍶 \ )$, then $(☕ \succ 🍶)$  ( for any $\{☕ \ , 🍵 \ , 🍶 \ \} \in 🫖 \ $)
:::

## Rational Preferences (cont.)

Another key assumption of rationality is that we can represent preferences by real numbers.

A [utility function]{.h} maps a choice to a single number.

For example, let $u(.)$ be the utility function from emoji to utils

  * I can have $u(🍺) =5$, $u(🌯)=10$, $u(🤸)=25$

  * I can also have $u(🍺 \ , 🌯) = 20$, $u(🍺 \ , 🌯 \ , 🤸) = 15$

## State-dependent utility table
Sometimes my enjoyment of a thing depends on the *state* of the world

| My choice   | My friends' choice | My utility |
|-------------|:------------------:|:----------:|
| Duck's game |     Duck's game    |     3      |
| Duck's game |      Stay home     |     2      |
|  Stay home  |     Duck's game    |     1      |
| Stay home   |      Stay home     |     2      |

: socially-dependent preferences {.striped .hover}

## Don't worry!
::: {.incremental}
* For this class, you won't need to worry about utility functions (if you want to, take EC311).

* I will almost always give you specific values of utility which we will call [payoffs]{.hi}.

* The table on the previous page is a good example.
:::

## What you need to know about Utility:
* As long as people are *rational*;
  i.e., they can consistently rank all alternatives,
  then we can represent their preferences with real numbers

## Information and Beliefs
This is where it starts to get tricky.
For most situations, 
as game theorists we have to take a stand on what people ***know***
and what they ***believe***.

::: {.incremental}
  * Many games contain *perfectly informed* players
    who know not only their own preferences,
    but also the preferences of other players. 
    In sequential move games, 
    they can also perfectly observe the moves that players before them made.
    - this is a very strong assumption

  * We can relax that last part in games of *asymmetric information* in which some players' strategies (or types) cannot be observed by all players.
