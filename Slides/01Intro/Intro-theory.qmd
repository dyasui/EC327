## Theory in a data-driven world? ^[adapted from Glen Waddell's microeconometrics class]
  > "The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions
immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an
apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking which helps its possessor to draw
correct conclusions." â€” Keynes

## Why is theory useful?
::: {.incremental}
[helps us simplify and understand complex systems]{.hi}
  - Social systems are really hard, game theory helps us focus on small parts at a time

[lets us generate *falsifiable* & *testable* hypotheses]{.hi}
  - Good econometrics is informed by good theory

[gives us common ground to analyze important questions]{.hi}
  - I often see debates devolve into people arguing on differences of definitions. 
    How can we focus on the details that really matter?
