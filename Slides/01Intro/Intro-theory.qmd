# What is Theory?

## Theory in a data-driven world? ^[adapted from Glen Waddell's microeconometrics class]
  > "The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions
immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an
apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking which helps its possessor to draw
correct conclusions." â€” Keynes

## Why is theory useful?

::: {.incremental}

[helps us simplify and understand complex systems]{.hi}

  - Social systems are really hard, game theory helps us focus on small parts at a time

[lets us generate *falsifiable* & *testable* hypotheses]{.hi}

  - Good econometrics is informed by good theory

[gives us common ground to analyze important questions]{.hi}

  - How can we focus on the details that really matter?

::: notes

  * Use map example:
  
  * World Atlas or UOCampus Map?
  
  * Which is better depends on which is more useful

## What are the limits to theory?

::: {.incremental}

  * Our models will never be perfect representations of reality
  
  * But we should know how well they *approximate* the parts of the world we want to understand
  
  * Theory is very useful for generating *falsifiable hypotheses*, which we can then use to guide experimental or statistical tests
  
  * As we play games in class, we will observe the data and compare to our theoretical predictions
