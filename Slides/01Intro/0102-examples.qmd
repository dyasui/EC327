## Examples of *strategic games*:

If 100% of your grade in this class is decided by a *curve*, how much should you study?

::: {.incremental}
  - How many people would still study?
  - What if you know everyone else won't study?
  - This is only hypothetical for this class! Don't expect a curve!
:::

  - Curving the grade makes your payoff depend on everyone else
  - So people might think strategically about their studying
  - Is it possible to get everyone to agree to shirk?
