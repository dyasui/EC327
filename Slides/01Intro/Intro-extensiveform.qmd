# Representing Games with the Extensive Form

## Examples

  * So far, we defined a game with a bunch of definitions.
   But it probably all seems pretty abstract. 
   
  * I'll try to make it more concrete by going through some examples.

## Kidnapping Game ^[Harrington, pg 18]
A kidnapper named [Guy]{.hi} has contacted the victim's wife, named [Vivica]{.hi}, to demand a ransom. 
To predict what will happen to the victim, [Orlando]{.hi}, we need to create a game theoretic model of the situation. 
Let's use the language of the tree graph to visualize this game.

## Applying the Extensive Form
::: {.incremental}
* Who are the players?
* Where are the decision nodes?
* What are the branches? What do they represent?
* What do the terminal nodes represent?

| **Outcome**                                    | [**Guy**]{.red}   | [**Vivica**]{.blue}   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| No kidnapping                                  | [3]{.red}         | [5]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, ransom paid, Orlando killed        | [4]{.red}         | [1]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, ransom paid, Orlando released      | [5]{.red}         | [3]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, no ransom paid, Orlando killed     | [2]{.red}         | [2]{.blue}            |
| Kidnapping, no ransom paid, Orlando released   | [1]{.red}         | [4]{.blue}            |

## Predictions?

Based on the extensive form game tree with payoffs, do you have any predictions for what strategies each player will choose?

  * What details should a predictive model of this situation take into account or leave out?

## Definition of an Extensive Form Game:

  * A collection of decision-makers, called [players]{.hi} or *agents* 
  * A set of [decision nodes]{.hi}, each of which represents the information available to the players in that node
  * [Branches]{.hi} from each node which represent the possible strategies available to the players
  * The entire game tree serves as the [mapping]{.h} from intersections of players' strategy profiles to the outcomes at each [terminal nodes]{.hi}
  * [Preferences]{.h} of each player over all [terminal nodes]{.hi}
