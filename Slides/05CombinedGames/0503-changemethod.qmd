## Rollback in the Kidnap Game

Rollback solution with
[perfect information]{.hi}:

  * \{ ([$Kidnap, Release, Kill$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

. . .

  * In other words:
    
    + Guy [$kidnaps$]{.red},
    promises to [$release$]{.red} if ransom paid,
    otherwise threatens [$kill$]{.red}

      - rational if he believes Vivica will pay the ransom.

    + Vivica [$pays$]{.blue} 
    
      - rational if she believes Guy's threat/promise above

  * Is this the only stable outcome?
    
    + It depends on beliefs!

## New Nash Eq. in Kidnap Game

We found \{ ([$Kidnap, Release, Kill$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

through backwards induction.

. . .

Through BR analysis in Strategic form:

  * Any strategy profile where:
    + Guy Doesn't Kidnap (DNK,K,K; DNK,K,R; DNK,R,K; DNK,R,R)
    + Vivica Doesn't Pay
  * is also a Nash

The rollback eq. is not the only NE of this game!

---

## NE vs SPNE

::: {.incremental .small}
  * What is different about *rollback* eq. and other Nash?
    
    + Backwards induction rules out threats that aren't *credible*
  
  * Vivica could threaten to not pay ransom

    + If Guy believes this, he would get 2 or 1 by Kidnapping,
      - or 3 by not kidnapping
  
    + Don't kidnap, Don't pay NE are stable

      - given certain *beliefs*
  
  * But if Guy's really savvy,

    + He should rationally state his preference of killing if paid, release if unpaid

    + he should know Vivica wouldn't follow through once really faced with decision of 3 vs 2

    + Vivica's threat of "I won't pay" isn't *credible*

      - It's not subgame rational

:::

---

## Rollback in the Kidnap Game

\{ ([$Kidnap, Kill_3, Release_4$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

On top of being a regular NE, this strategy profile is also called [subgame-perfect]{.hi}
because both players' actions are *credible*:

::: {.incremental}
  + Guy's threat of killing Orlando if the ransom goes unpaid aligns with his preference
  + His promise to release Orlando if the ransom *is* paid is also credible because he would rather not kill if he gets the money
  + Vivica has every reason to pay the ransom when she believes guy will make good on his threat
    because she doesn't want Orlando to die

# Simultaneous Games in Sequential Form

## Illustrating Sim. Games using Trees

### Martina Navratilova v. Chris Evert

| Evert, Navratilova |   DL   |   CC   |
|:------------------:+:------:+:------:|
|       **DL**       | 50, 50 | 80, 20 |
|       **CC**       | 90, 10 | 20, 80 |

Navratilova has volleyed the ball to Evert

  * Evert can send the ball down the line, **DL**, 
    or crosscourt **CC** (a softer diagonal shot)

  * Navratilova has to simultaneously choose to set up to receive either type of shot

## Illustrating Sim. Games using Trees

The simultaneous tennis game can also be represented as a tree

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.7.png)

The [information set]{.hi} indicates that Navratilova doesn't know which shot before she has to choose how to receive

## Adding Nature as a player

Even in cases which aren't actually *strategic*, 
we can still use some of these tools

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.8.png)

## Changing the order of Moves

We found the NE will be (**Deficit**, **High Rates**)
when this game is played simultaneously

| Congress, Federal Reserve | Low rates | High Rates |
|:-------------------------:+:---------:+:----------:|
|        **Balance**        |    3, 4   |    1, 3    |
|        **Deficit**        |    4, 1   |    2, 2    |

## Changing the order of Moves

What about when the Fed moves first?

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.6b.png)

::: {.incremental}

  * We get the same NE

:::
---

## Changing the order of Moves

What about when Congress moves first?

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.6c.png)

::: {.incremental}

  * now we get a different NE with congress playing their strictly dominated strategy

  * this is because when the Fed acts second, they can make a *credible threat*

:::

---

## Showing Seq. Games in Strategic Form

In the game where Congress moves first,
they have two strategies, but the Fed has 4

| Congress, Fed | L if B, H if D | H if B, L if D | always Low | always H |
|---------------+----------------+----------------+------------+----------|
| **Balance**   | 3,4            | 1,3            | 3,4        | 1,3      |
| **Deficit**   | 2,2            | 4,1            | 4,1        | 2,2      |

---

## Showing Seq. Games in Strategic Form

When we implemented *rollback* on the extensive form version,
there was only one NE,

  * but here there are two: 

    + \{**Deficit**, always **High** \}
    
    + \{ **Balance**, (**L** if B, **H** if D) \}

Both are NE of this game, but the second is a special type of NE

A [subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium]{.hi} because it involves the Fed making their rational choice in every subgame.

## Showing Seq. Games in Strategic Form

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.6c.png)

It's not *subgame-rational* for the Fed to play **High always**
because if the case where Congress already spent in deficit were to happen,
the Fed's only rational action would be to set low interest rates.

  * We can say that the Fed's **High always** strategy is not a [credible]{.hi} promise

## SPNE

The rollback method finds the [subgame-perfect Nash equilibria]{.hi} of sequential games

  * A complete plan of action such that at every node *including off-equilibrium* paths, it is still rational to stick to that original plan of action.
