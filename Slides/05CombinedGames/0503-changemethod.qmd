## Illustrating Sim. Games using Trees

### Martina Navratilova v. Chris Evert

| Evert, Navratilova |   DL   |   CC   |
|:------------------:+:------:+:------:|
|       **DL**       | 50, 50 | 80, 20 |
|       **CC**       | 90, 10 | 20, 80 |

Navratilova has volleyed the ball to Evert

  * Evert can send the ball down the line, **DL**, 
    or crosscourt **CC** (a softer diagonal shot)

  * Navratilova has to simultaneously choose to set up to receive either type of shot

## Illustrating Sim. Games using Trees

The simultaneous tennis game can also be represented as a tree

The [information set]{.hi} indicates that Navratilova doesn't know which shot before she has to choose how to receive

## Adding Nature as a player

Even in cases which aren't actually *strategic*, 
we can still use some of these tools

## Changing the order of Moves

We found the NE will be (**Deficit**, **High Rates**)
when this game is played simultaneously

| Congress, Federal Reserve | Low rates | High Rates |
|:-------------------------:+:---------:+:----------:|
|        **Balance**        |    3, 4   |    1, 3    |
|        **Deficit**        |    4, 1   |    2, 2    |

## Changing the order of Moves

What about when the Fed moves first?

::: {.incremental}

  * We get the same NE

## Changing the order of Moves

What about when Congress moves first?

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.6c.png)

::: {.incremental}

  * now we get a different NE with congress playing their strictly dominated strategy

  * this is because when the Fed acts second, they can make a *credible threat*

## Showing Seq. Games in Strategic Form

In the game where Congress moves first,
they have two strategies, but the Fed has 4

| Congress, Fed | L if B, H if D | H if B, L if D | always Low | always H |
|---------------+----------------+----------------+------------+----------|
| **Balance**   | 3,4            | 1,3            | 3,4        | 1,3      |
| **Deficit**   | 2,2            | 4,1            | 4,1        | 2,2      |

## Showing Seq. Games in Strategic Form

When we implemented *rollback* on the extensive form version,
there was only one NE,

  * but here there are two: 

    + \{**Deficit**, always **High** \}
    
    + \{ **Balance**, (**L** if B, **H** if D) \}

Both are NE of this game, but the second is a special type of NE

A [subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium]{.hi} because it involves the Fed making their rational choice in every subgame.

## Showing Seq. Games in Strategic Form

![](figures/Dixit_fig6.6c.png)

It's not *subgame-rational* for the Fed to play **High always**
because if the case where Congress already spent in deficit were to happen,
the Fed's only rational action would be to set low interest rates.

  * We can say that the Fed's **High always** strategy is not a [credible]{.hi} promise

## SPNE

The rollback method finds the [subgame-perfect Nash equilibria]{.hi} of sequential games

  * A complete plan of action such that at every node *including off-equilibrium* paths, it is still rational to stick to that original plan of action.
