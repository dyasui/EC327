# Games with both Simultaneous and Sequential Moves

<!-- ## Games with both types of moves

We separated games by the timing of moves in the first few lectures

  * it allowed us to introduce the relevant methods for each category

  * it also gave us the intuition behind the more general concept of Nash Equilibrium in a few different settings

  * but for many types of settings there are a mix of actions that are taken both *sequentially* and also taken *simultaneously*

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

[CrossTalk]{.h} and [GlobalDialog]{.h} are competing telecom companies

  * Each could invest $10 billion in fiber-optic infrastructure

::: {.incremenatl}

  * If only one company has fiber-optic, they get the entire market

    + A monopolist can charge **high** price $\rightarrow$ earn $24 billion

    + or a **low** price to attract more customers $\rightarrow$ earn $16 billion

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

[CrossTalk]{.h} and [GlobalDialog]{.h} are competing telecom companies

  * Each could invest $10 billion in fiber-optic infrastructure

::: {.incremental}

  * If *both* companies invest, they are locked in a ***simultaneous*** pricing game

    + If both set **high** price in the fiber-optic market, each gets $12 billion

    + If both choose **low**, they each get $8 billion

    + If one sets **high** and the other sets **low**, 
      
      - the low-price setter gets the whole market and earns $24 billion,

      - the high price setter gets $0

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

We can use our tools from solving both game trees and game tables 

::: {.incremental}

  * first, notice that a monopolist will always set a **High** price

  * So we can replace the payoffs from the **High** branch into the first-stage table

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

Take a look at the table labelled Second stage:

| CrossTalk, GlobalDialog |  High  |   Low  |
|:-----------------------:+:------:+:------:|
|         **High**        |  2, 2  | -10, 6 |
|         **Low**         | 6, -10 | -2, -2 |

::: {.incremental}

This is itself a complete game nested in the larger one

  * so it's whats is called a [subgame]{.hi}

  * we can solve it like we would any other game table

  * The NE of this subgame is (**Low**, **Low**) 

  * place the Nash payoffs of -2, -2 into the first-stage table

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

First-stage game with payoffs filled in:

| CrossTalk, GlobalDialog |   Don't   |   Invest   |
|:-----------------------:+:---------:+:----------:|
|        **Don't**        |    0, 0   |  0, **14** |
|        **Invest**       | **14**, 0 | **-2, -2** |

::: {.incremental}
Now we can solve for the NE of the whole game:
  
  * (**Invest** **High** **Low**, **Don't** **High** **Low**)

  * (**Don't** **High** **Low**, **Invest** **High** **Low**)

### Football play game

In football, each team chooses a play to run in the huddle where the other team can't observe

  * after this *simultaneous* action which is not observable to their opponent, the teams line up at which point the coach *can* observe how the defensive team are aligned and choose to potentially pick a different play accordingly

  * The defensive team could in also choose to respond to the offensive play changing their play
