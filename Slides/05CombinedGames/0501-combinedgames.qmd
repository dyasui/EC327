# Games with both Simultaneous and Sequential Moves

## Games with both types of moves

We separated games by the timing of moves in the first few lectures

  * it allowed us to introduce the relevant methods for each category

  * it also gave us the intuition behind the more general concept of Nash Equilibrium in a few different settings

  * but for many types of settings there are a mix of actions that are taken both *sequentially* and also taken *simultaneously*

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

[CrossTalk]{.h} and [GlobalDialog]{.h} are competing telecom companies

  * Each could invest $10 billion in fiber-optic infrastructure

::: {.incremenatl}

  * If only one company has fiber-optic, they get the entire market

    + A monopolist can charge **high** price $\rightarrow$ earn $24 billion

    + or a **low** price to attract more customers $\rightarrow$ earn $16 billion

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

[CrossTalk]{.h} and [GlobalDialog]{.h} are competing telecom companies

  * Each could invest $10 billion in fiber-optic infrastructure

::: {.incremental}

  * If *both* companies invest, they are locked in a ***simultaneous*** pricing game

    + If both set **high** price in the fiber-optic market, each gets $12 billion

    + If both choose **low**, they each get $8 billion

    + If one sets **high** and the other sets **low**, 
      
      - the low-price setter gets the whole market and earns $24 billion,

      - the high price setter gets $0

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

We can use our tools from solving both game trees and game tables 

::: {.incremental}

  * first, notice that a monopolist will always set a **High** price

  * So we can replace the payoffs from the **High** branch into the first-stage table

:::

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

Take a look at the table labelled Second stage:

| CrossTalk, GlobalDialog |  High  |   Low  |
|:-----------------------:+:------:+:------:|
|         **High**        |  2, 2  | -10, 6 |
|         **Low**         | 6, -10 | -2, -2 |

::: {.incremental}

This is itself a complete game nested in the larger one

  * so it's whats is called a [subgame]{.hi}

  * we can solve it like we would any other game table

  * The NE of this subgame is (**Low**, **Low**) 

  * place the Nash payoffs of -2, -2 into the first-stage table

## Two-Stage Games & Subgames

First-stage game with payoffs filled in:

| CrossTalk, GlobalDialog |   Don't   |   Invest   |
|:-----------------------:+:---------:+:----------:|
|        **Don't**        |    0, 0   |  0, **14** |
|        **Invest**       | **14**, 0 | **-2, -2** |

::: {.incremental}
Now we can solve for the NE of the whole game:
  
  * (**Invest** **High** **Low**, **Don't** **High** **Low**)

  * (**Don't** **High** **Low**, **Invest** **High** **Low**)

### Football play game

In football, each team chooses a play to run in the huddle where the other team can't observe

  * after this *simultaneous* action which is not observable to their opponent, the teams line up at which point the coach *can* observe how the defensive team are aligned and choose to potentially pick a different play accordingly

  * The defensive team could in also choose to respond to the offensive play changing their play

## Kidnapping with hidden information

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](figures/kidnapgame_infoset.png)
:::
::: {.column}

  * When we first saw this game,
  Guy could observe whether Vivica had paid the ransom 
  before he made the decision to $Kill$ or $Release$ Orlando

  * Now we will consider a variation of this game 
  where Guy doesnt know whether Vivica has paid when he chooses to Kill or Release

## Kidnap Game with a simultaneous subgame

:::: {.incremental}

  * The dotted box around Guy's nodes $N_3$ and $N_4$
  indicate that he can't tell them apart.

  * They are part of the same [information set]{.hi}; 
  to Guy, they are indistinguishable from each other.

::: {.callout-note}
### Information set 
is the set of information available to a player when making a decision. 
In the extensive form, 
every decision node belongs to one and only one info set,
but multiple nodes may be in the same info set 
if the player at that node cannot tell them apart.

## Using Strategic Form in Extensive Games

Consider the situation when Guy has already kidnapped Orlando.

List the remaining strategies for each player:

::: {.incremental}

  * Vivica can decide to **Pay** or **Don't** pay the ransom

  * Guy can either **Kill** or **Release** Orlando

## Using Strategic Form in Extensive Games

With these strategy profiles,
we can write this subgame out in its strategic form:

| Guy, Vivica | Pay  | Don't |
|-------------+------+-------|
| **Kill**    | 4, 1 | 2, 2  |
| **Release** | 5, 3 | 1, 4  |

---


## Going from Strategic to Extensive
  
For every strategic form game, 
there are multiple extensive form game trees
which can be drawn.

## Solving the Kidnap Game w/ Simultaneous Sugame

What will a complete strategy profile look like for each player?

::: {.incremental}
  * Guy's strategy:
    + element 1: [$Kidnap$]{.red} or [$Don't~Kidnap$]{.red}
    + element 2: [$Kill$]{.red} or [$Release$]{.red}
  * Vivica's strategy:
    + element 1: [$Pay$]{.blue} or [$Don't$]{.blue}

## Solving the Kidnap Game w/ Simultaneous Sugame

What is/are the NE of the subgame?

|                   | [$Pay$]{.blue} | [$Don't$]{.blue} |
|-------------------+----------------+------------------|
| [$Kill$]{.red}    | 4,1            | 2,2              |
| [$Release$]{.red} | 5,3            | 1,4              |


::: {.incremental}
  * ([$Release$]{.red}, [$Pay$]{.blue}) is no longer *stable* 
  because Vivica wouldn't pay the ransom if Guy releases

  * ([$Kill$]{.red}, [$Don't$]{.blue}) is the only NE in this table
:::

## Solving the Kidnap Game w/ Simultaneous Sugame

Knowing this, what is the NE in the full game?

![](figures/kidnapgame_combined.png)

. . .

  * \{ ([$Don't~Kidnap$, $Kill$]{.red}), [$Don't~pay$]{.blue} \}

---

## Comparing NE in the different Kidnapping Games

In the version where Vivica's action was *observable*,
we found the NE:

  * \{ ([$Kidnap, Kill_3, Release_4$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

But in the version where Guy couldn't see whether Vivica paid the ransom,
it was:

  * \{ ([$Don't~Kidnap$, $Kill$]{.red}), [$Don't~pay$]{.blue} \}


::: {.incremental}
  * If you were Guy, which version would you prefer?
  * Guy's advantage is in making a conditional promise/threat to Vivica
  which is taken away if he can only pick one action
