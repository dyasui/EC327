## Combining Sequential and Simultaneous

::: {.incremental}

  * So far, we have only seen games that were either made up of 
  *only sequential* or *only simultaneous* moves.

  * But realistically, 
  many strategic interactions will contain both types of moves.

  * Learning to move between extensive and strategic form 
  will help us examine more complicated games,
  as well as introduce us to the roll of *information* and beliefs
  which will become useful to later topics.

## Modifying the game

::: {.column}

  * When we first saw this game,
  Vivica could observe whether Guy had killed Orlando before she paid the ransom. 

  * Now we will consider a variation of this game 
  where Orlando's fate is decided by Guy 
  *without Vivica knowing the result*.

## Kidnap Game with a simultaneous subgame

:::: {.incremental}

  * The dotted box around Vivica's nodes $N_3$ and $N_4$
  indicate that she can't tell them apart.

  * They are part of the same [information set]{.hi}; 
  to Vivica, they are indistinguishable from each other.

::: {.callout-note}
### Information set 
is the set of information available to a player when making a decision. 
In the extensive form, 
every decision node belongs to one and only one info set,
but multiple nodes may be in the same info set 
if the player at that node cannot tell them apart.

## Using Strategic Form in Extensive Games

Consider the situation when Guy has already kidnapped Orlando.

List the remaining strategies for each player:

::: {.incremental}

  * Vivica can decide to **Pay** or **Don't** pay the ransom

  * Guy can either **Kill** or **Release** Orlando

## Using Strategic Form in Extensive Games

With these strategy profiles,
we can write this subgame out in its strategic form:

| Guy, Vivica | Pay  | Don't |
|-------------+------+-------|
| **Kill**    | 4, 1 | 2, 2  |
| **Release** | 5, 3 | 1, 4  |

## Going from Strategic to Extensive
  
For every strategic form game, 
there are multiple extensive form game trees
which can be drawn.

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Another way to represent the entire Kidnap Game

![](figures/kidnapgametreetable.png)

## A Strategic Form representation

Here is the game matrix for the entire kidnapping game:

| Vivica, Guy | $dnk,k$ | $dnk,r$ | $kid,k$ | $kid,r$ |
|-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| $pay$       | $5,3$   | $5,3$   | $1,4$   | $3,5$   |
| $no~pay$    | $5,3$   | $5,3$   | $2,2$   | $4,1$   |

::: {.incremental}
  * Notice that the left half of the table represent the single *don't kidnap* branch in the original tree
  * What are the NE?
    + ($pay$, $kid,k$) is one
    + ($no~pay$, $dnk,k$) and ($no~pay$, $dnk,r$) are also NE for this game table
:::

## NE vs SPNE

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
![](figures/kidnap_tree1.png)
::::
:::: {.column}
| Vivica, Guy | $dnk,k$ | $dnk,r$ | $kid,k$ | $kid,r$ |
|-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| $pay$       | $5,3$   | $5,3$   | $1,4$   | $3,5$   |
| $no~pay$    | $5,3$   | $5,3$   | $2,2$   | $4,1$   |

::: {.incremental .small}
  * What is different about the NE we found in the table
    and the NE we found through *rollback*?
  
  * The NE where Vivica plays $no~pay$ are not Subgame Perfect
    because those actions are not [credible threats]{.hi}
