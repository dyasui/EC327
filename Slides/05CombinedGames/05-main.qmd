## Combining Sequential and Simultaneous

::: {.incremental}

  * So far, we have only seen games that were either made up of 
  *only sequential* or *only simultaneous* moves.

  * But realistically, 
  many strategic interactions will contain both types of moves.

  * Learning to move between extensive and strategic form 
  will help us examine more complicated games,
  as well as introduce us to the roll of *information* and beliefs
  which will become useful to later topics.

    + [Kidnap]{.red} (5 > 3)

## Rollback in the Kidnap Game

So the rollback solution in this version of the game where both players
have [perfect information]{.hi} about all previous actions is:

  * \{ ([$Kidnap, Kill_3, Release_4$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

. . .

  * In other words:
    
    + Guy [$kidnaps$]{.red} because he believes Vivica will pay the ransom.
    He threatens to [$kill$]{.red} if Vivica doesn't pay,
    but promises to [$release$]{.red} if she does pay

    + Vivica [$pays$]{.blue} because she believes Guy's threat/promise

---

## Rollback in the Kidnap Game

\{ ([$Kidnap, Kill_3, Release_4$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

On top of being a regular NE, this strategy profile is also called [subgame-perfect]{.hi}
because both players' actions are *credible*:

::: {.incremental}
  + Guy's threat of killing Orlando if the ransom goes unpaid aligns with his preference
  + His promise to release Orlando if the ransom *is* paid is also credible because he would rather not kill if he gets the money
  + Vivica has every reason to pay the ransom when she believes guy will make good on his threat
    because she doesn't want Orlando to die
:::

## Modifying the game

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](figures/kidnapgame_infoset.png)
:::
::: {.column}

  * When we first saw this game,
  Guy could observe whether Vivica had paid the ransom 
  before he made the decision to $Kill$ or $Release$ Orlando

  * Now we will consider a variation of this game 
  where Guy doesnt know whether Vivica has paid when he chooses to Kill or Release

:::
::::

---


## Kidnap Game with a simultaneous subgame

:::: {.incremental}

  * The dotted box around Guy's nodes $N_3$ and $N_4$
  indicate that he can't tell them apart.

  * They are part of the same [information set]{.hi}; 
  to Guy, they are indistinguishable from each other.

::: {.callout-note}
### Information set 
is the set of information available to a player when making a decision. 
In the extensive form, 
every decision node belongs to one and only one info set,
but multiple nodes may be in the same info set 
if the player at that node cannot tell them apart.
:::

::::

---

## Using Strategic Form in Extensive Games

Consider the situation when Guy has already kidnapped Orlando.

List the remaining strategies for each player:

::: {.incremental}

  * Vivica can decide to **Pay** or **Don't** pay the ransom

  * Guy can either **Kill** or **Release** Orlando
  
:::

---

## Using Strategic Form in Extensive Games

With these strategy profiles,
we can write this subgame out in its strategic form:

| Guy, Vivica | Pay  | Don't |
|-------------+------+-------|
| **Kill**    | 4, 1 | 2, 2  |
| **Release** | 5, 3 | 1, 4  |

---


## Going from Strategic to Extensive
  
For every strategic form game, 
there are multiple extensive form game trees
which can be drawn.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

## Another way to represent the entire Kidnap Game

## Solving the Kidnap Game w/ Simultaneous Sugame

What will a complete strategy profile look like for each player?

::: {.incremental}
  * Guy's strategy:
    + element 1: [$Kidnap$]{.red} or [$Don't~Kidnap$]{.red}
    + element 2: [$Kill$]{.red} or [$Release$]{.red}
  * Vivica's strategy:
    + element 1: [$Pay$]{.blue} or [$Don't$]{.blue}
:::

---

## Solving the Kidnap Game w/ Simultaneous Sugame

What is/are the NE of the subgame?

|                   | [$Pay$]{.blue} | [$Don't$]{.blue} |
|-------------------+----------------+------------------|
| [$Kill$]{.red}    | 4,1            | 2,2              |
| [$Release$]{.red} | 5,3            | 1,4              |


::: {.incremental}
  * ([$Release$]{.red}, [$Pay$]{.blue}) is no longer *stable* 
  because Vivica wouldn't pay the ransom if Guy releases

  * ([$Kill$]{.red}, [$Don't$]{.blue}) is the only NE in this table
:::

---

## Solving the Kidnap Game w/ Simultaneous Sugame

Knowing this, what is the NE in the full game?

![](figures/kidnapgame_combined.png)

. . .

  * \{ ([$Don't~Kidnap$, $Kill$]{.red}), [$Don't~pay$]{.blue} \}

---

## Comparing NE in the different Kidnapping Games

In the version where Vivica's action was *observable*,
we found the NE:

  * \{ ([$Kidnap, Kill_3, Release_4$]{.red}), [$Pay$]{.blue} \}

But in the version where Guy couldn't see whether Vivica paid the ransom,
it was:

  * \{ ([$Don't~Kidnap$, $Kill$]{.red}), [$Don't~pay$]{.blue} \}


::: {.incremental}
  * If you were Guy, which version would you prefer?
  * Guy's advantage is in making a conditional promise/threat to Vivica
  which is taken away if he can only pick one action
:::
---

## A Strategic Form representation

Here is the game matrix for the entire kidnapping game:
(when Guy can see Vivica's action)

| [Guy]{.red}, [Vivica]{.blue}   |          Pay          |       Don't Pay       |
|--------------------------------+:---------------------:+:---------------------:|
| [DNK, Kill, Kill]{.h}          | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} |
| [DNK, Kill, Release]{.h}       | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} |
| [DNK, Release, Kill]{.h}       | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} |
| [DNK, Release, Release]{.h}    | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} | [3]{.red}, [5]{.blue} |
| [Kidnap, Kill, Kill]{.h}       | [4]{.red}, [1]{.blue} | [2]{.red}, [2]{.blue} |
| [Kidnap, Kill, Release]{.h}    | [4]{.red}, [1]{.blue} | [1]{.red}, [4]{.blue} |
| [Kidnap, Release, Kill]{.h}    | [5]{.red}, [3]{.blue} | [2]{.red}, [2]{.blue} |
| [Kidnap, Release, Release]{.h} | [5]{.red}, [3]{.blue} | [1]{.red}, [4]{.blue} |

## NE vs SPNE

::: {.incremental .small}
  * What is different about the NE we found in the table
    and the NE we found through *rollback*?
  
  * The NE where Vivica plays $no~pay$ are not Subgame Perfect
    because those actions are not [credible threats]{.hi}

    + She can only credibly threaten not paying the ransom
    if she knows Guy can't observe her action
