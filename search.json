The game helps illustrate concepts such as escalation, risk tolerance, and backward induction in strategic situations. It also provides an opportunity to analyze how uncertainty and risk preferences influence negotiation outcomes.\nReference:\nHaun, P., & O‚ÄôHara, M. (2022).

Each round increases the risk of escalation, resulting in both players losing everything.\n\nRound 1: Player 1 chooses between:\n\nSplitting the pot (1 coin for themselves and 9 coins for Player 2).\nRolling the die. If the die roll is 1, escalation occurs, and both players receive 0 coins. If the roll is greater than 1, the game proceeds to Round 2.\n\nRound 2: Player 2 chooses between:\n\nSplitting the pot (8 coins for Player 1 and 2 coins for themselves).\nRolling the die. If the roll is 1 or 2, escalation occurs. If the roll is greater than 2, the game proceeds to Round 3.\n\nSubsequent Rounds: Similar logic follows, with the split amounts changing each round:\n\nRound 3: (3, 7)\nRound 4: (6, 4)\nRound 5: (5, 5)\nRound 6: (4, 6)\n\n\nThe risk of escalation increases in each round. By Round 6, rolling the die becomes extremely risky, with only a 1-in-6 chance of avoiding escalation.\nEnd Conditions:\nThe game ends if:\n\nPlayers choose to split the pot in any round.\nEscalation occurs after a low die roll.\nThe sixth round is completed with no escalation.",

This adjustment allows us to evaluate whether groups overproduced or underproduced relative to what they could collectively achieve through collusion.\nIf instead of a monopoly, several firms were acting competing in an oligopoly, thier individual best-response functions would be:\n\\[\nquantity_i = \\frac{a}{2b} - \\frac{\\sum_{j\\neq i}^N quantity_j}{2}\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(quantity_i\\) is the quantity produced by the single firm \\(i\\)\n\\(quantity_j\\) are the individual quantities produced by firms besides \\(i\\)\n\\(N\\) is the total number of firms in the market\n\nOne example of an oligopolistic equilibrium would be all competing firms set the same price, in which each firm chooses the individual quantity \\(quantity_i^{oligopoly} = \\frac{a}{b(N+1)}\\).\nIf firms could cooperate and decide to split the Monopolist‚Äôs quantity amongst each other, where \\(quantity_i^{collusion} = \\frac{Q_{mp}}{N}\\), they would produce fewer ads than in the equilibrium above, and jointly earn higher profit.\n\n\nSee the code\n# modify data for plotting\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(round) %&gt;%\n  mutate(num_firms = sum(!is.na(quantity))) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  # standardize quantity by `a` and `b` of each round\n  mutate(\n    Q_mp = a/(2*b), # monopolist's quantity\n    # equal split of monopoly quantity across all firms\n    q_mp = Q_mp / num_firms,\n    # divide actual quantities by cooperative quantities\n    q_adj = quantity / q_mp\n  ) \ndata\n\n\n# A tibble: 90 √ó 12\n   group round quantity     a     b     Q     P    pi num_firms  Q_mp  q_mp\n   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1     1          100   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 2 2     1          100   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 3 3     1           12   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 4 4     1           75   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 5 5     1           43   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 6 6     1            3   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 7 8     1          105   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 8 9     1          100   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n 9 10    1           48   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n10 11    1           45   162   1.5   631     0     0        10    54   5.4\n# ‚Ñπ 80 more rows\n# ‚Ñπ 1 more variable: q_adj &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Course Description\nThis course introduces the field of game theory, which involves the analysis of strategic situations; where the consequences one person‚Äôs choice depend on the actions of others. The examples of settings we may discuss range from simple games like rock, paper, scissors; to more complicated games of incomplete information in the market for used cars.\nWe will introduce the general concept of equilibrium and explore the different forms of equilbria in different settings. Students will learn through in-person lectures and discussions, and build their own skills through participation in in-class activities.\nThis elective is suitable for economics majors and anyone interested in understanding the strategic dynamics that shape our decisions."

    "text": "Course Details\n\nCourse Pages:\n\nCanvas: The class Canvas page will be where you submit graded assignments and where you can check your current grade.\nCourse Website\n\nThis website will be kept up to date with the current class schedule, activities, assignments, and slides.\n\n\nPrerequisites:\nOne of EC101 or EC201.\nThe most important prerequisite skills you will need for this class are mainly college-level algebra and working with simple systems of equations. If it has been a while since your last math class, it may be helpful to review concepts like linear equations, graphing of equations, and factoring quadratics (for example units 1-5 of the Khan Academy course).\n\n\nObjectives:\nThis course aims to help you to understand the fundamental principles of game theory, become familiar with basic classes of games, practice the mathematical skills to solve for the appropriate equilibria, apply game theoretic models to real-world interactions, and recognize limitations and critiques of the theory.\n\n\nTextbook:\n\nGames of Strategy by Avinash Dixit, Susan Skeath, and David McAdams, 5th edition.\n\nThe most recent edition of the E-book is available from the publisher. If you have an older or newer edition of this book, please make sure that the chapters align with the topics on the class schedule.\nAny other readings I assign (for example articles, news stories, etc.) will be posted on the course website.\n\n\nAttendance:\nThis is an in-person class that will meet at the times specified in the UO Class Schedule. Regular attendance and active participation is expected. You will demonstrate your attendence by participating in regular in-class activities and group discussions.\nIf you are unable to attend class for any reason, you are responsible for keeping track of whatever activites, discussions, and lecture material we cover in your absence. Please ask your classmates and check the website to see what you may have missed. If you miss more than two or three classes in the term, you should meet with the instructor to see what options are best for you to meet the class expectations.\n\n\nOffice Hours:\nThere will be two in-person office hour sections each week during which you will have the opportunity to meet with the instructor to ask for further clarification on class concepts, homework assignments, etc. These times are most effective if you come prepared with specific questions or topics that you want to discuss. Because my office space is limited, unless otherwise stated, office hours will be held in the Tykeson 352, on the third floor next to the blackboards. As office hour times are subject to change, please check the Canvas page for the most up to date schedule.\nIf you are unable to attend the scheduled office hour times, I am also available to meet by appointment."

Your Activities grade will be determinded by your participation (i.e., were you present, respectful, and engaged) as well as a short written report which you will submit to canvas. Depending on what we do in class, the report will outline the discussion you had with your classmates and/or record the data from the game you played.\nIf you are unable to attend class when we have an activity, you may make up for your lost participation by designing an alternative activity which you can complete on your own time in consultation with the instructor. Only up to 2 missed activities may be substituted for per quarter.\n\n\nQuizzes\nThere will also be a number of quizzes posted on Canvas which are mostly designed to keep you up to date with the reading. There will be one quiz for each assigned chapter and they will be due on the Friday of the week we cover that chapter in class. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.\n\n\nHomework\nTo help practice your understanding of the material, you will complete a written homework assignment covering the corresponding chapter every week. You will post your submissions as a single pdf file including all work. Answer keys will be automatically posted on the due date in Canvas, so no late submissions will be accepted. However, your lowest grade will be dropped at the end of the term.\nYour submissions will be graded not only on how well they match the rubric, but also on how clearly your submission demonstrates your understanding of the material.\n\n\nAI use policy\nFor this class, you may find it helpful to use `artificial intelligence‚Äô (AI) software tools like ChatGPT to brainstorm, create outlines, or summarize readings. However, any written content you submit for homework and demonstrate your own understanding of the material.\nIf you use any AI generated content to help you write your submission, your submission must also provide the following:\n\nAI Tool Details: What specific model, version, website provider did you use?\nPrompt: State the specific prompts you used when generating text, images, etc.\nAlignment: Describe what steps you took or how you edited the generated content to align with the rubric guidelines. This may include refining prompts, cross-referencing with lecture notes, or seeking clarification for ambiguous responses.\nDemonstrate Comprehension: Along with your answer, briefly evaluate how useful the AI tool was for your submission by highlighting what it got right and what you needed to correct.\n\n\n\nExams:\nExams will be in-person and closed-note.\nThere will be one midterm exam on week 5 and one final exam administered at the time specified in the Registrar‚Äôs final exam schedule. Each exam will have a multiple-choice section (based on quiz questions) and some long-answer questions (based on homework). You are allowed to bring a 3x5 inch handwritten notecard (front and back sides).\nIf you cannot attend the midterm due to extreme circumstances, you may choose to move the weight that would have been applied to the midterm score to your final exam instead. To qualify for re-weighting, a request must be submitted to the instructor no later than two days after the midterm."

To be strictly dominated, there must be one particular strategy** which is always better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the game below, there are no strictly dominated strategies, meaning that IESDS will not do anything to simplify it.\n\n\nHowever, we can see that B is non-rationalizable for Player 1: regardless of whether Player 2 chooses a, b, or c, Player 1 is better off playing either A or C.\nAlso, b is non-rationalizable for Player 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not rational to play a non-best-response strategy in a pure-strategy context. (As we‚Äôll see much later, it‚Äôs more complicated in a mixed-strategy context).\nAny strictly dominated strategy is also not a best response, but not all NBR strategies are strictly dominated.\nBecause of this, if we eliminate non-best-responses, using the same steps as IESDS, this process will always eliminate the same strategies, and it may eliminate even more!\nThis process is, naturally, called Iterative Elimination of Non-Best-Responses (IENBR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to this same example, we can start by eliminating B.\n\n\nOnce we do this, we can now see that b and c are non-rationalizable, and eliminate them.\nFinally, we can see that B is non-rationalizable and eliminate it, leaving only the strategy profile (C, a), which is the Nash equilibrium of this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter eliminating Z, which is strictly dominated, what strategy is a non-best-response?\n\nX\nY\nZ\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we complete IENBR on this game table, what strategy profile is left at the end?\n\n(X, x)\n(X, z)\n(Y, x)\n(Y, z)\nThere is more than one strategy profile left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere‚Äôs no guarantee that any particular game will contain strategies that are either strictly dominated or non-rationalizable.\nEven when there are strategies we can eliminate, there may not be enough of them to find a NE just by elimination.\nSo why bother with this?\nEven if elimination doesn‚Äôt immediately identify a NE, it can still be helpful to simplify the game before trying other methods.\nSimplifying by elimination is especially useful when dealing with mixed strategies‚Äîwhich we‚Äôll get to after the midterm."

This gives Guido a choice of two options: he can also keep Quiet, and get a short prison sentence, or he can Testify and get released.

Strategize: (5 minutes)\nDiscuss amongst your team as to how many ads you will allow for on your platform. Your strategy will be an integer quantity of ads slots to produce which will be bought by adverstisers at the going market rate.\n\n\n4. Market Opens:\nAfter each team has decided on their quantity of ads to produce, I will ask your CEO to report them to me. All firms quantities will be totaled and entered into the market demand curve to determine the price you will receive per ad.\n\n\n5. Calculate Profits & Discuss:\nHave your CFO write down the profit you earn this round after all other groups quantities have been entered. Also record the demand function‚Äôs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) of the round. Discuss your firm‚Äôs annual performance and make adjustments as necessary. After class you will submit your total profit after all rounds as well as discussion bullet points about how your team came up with a strategy, and how this activity relates to class material.",

    "text": "Game Rules:\n\nSetup\n\nStarting Resources: Each buyer starts with a budget of ¬£800. Each seller starts with one car card. Sellers should not reveal the quality of their car to anyone.\nCar Values: Good Cars: Resale value of ¬£600. Scrap value of ¬£400 (if unsold). Lemons: Resale value of ¬£200. Scrap value of ¬£150 (if unsold).\n\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game consists of 3 rounds. Each round follows this sequence:\n\nSellers List Cars: Each seller announces a starting price for their car. This price is public. Sellers can choose not to sell their car if they believe the offered price would not result in a profit.\nBuyers Bid: Buyers negotiate with sellers to purchase cars. Each buyer may purchase only one car per round. Buyers may also choose not to buy a car if they believe the prices are too high.\nTransactions: Once a buyer and seller agree on a price:\n\nThe buyer pays the agreed price, which is deducted from their budget.\nThe seller reveals the car‚Äôs true quality.\n\nSellers record the profit from the transaction (sale price minus car‚Äôs scrap value). Buyers record their remaining budget and the car‚Äôs resale value.\n\n\nOutside Options:\nBuyers who do not purchase a car keep their remaining budget as their final payoff for the round. Sellers who do not sell their car receive the scrap value instead:\n\n¬£400 for a good car.\n¬£150 for a lemon.\n\n\n\nEnd of Round:\nAll participants record their earnings:\n\nBuyers: Remaining budget + resale value of purchased car (if any).\nSellers: Sale profit or scrap value (if unsold).\n\nThe roles rotate so that each participant experiences being both a buyer and a seller.",
