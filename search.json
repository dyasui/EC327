To be strictly dominated, there must be one particular strategy** which is always better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the game below, there are no strictly dominated strategies, meaning that IESDS will not do anything to simplify it.\n\n\nHowever, we can see that B is non-rationalizable for Player 1: regardless of whether Player 2 chooses a, b, or c, Player 1 is better off playing either A or C.\nAlso, b is non-rationalizable for Player 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not rational to play a non-best-response strategy in a pure-strategy context. (As we’ll see much later, it’s more complicated in a mixed-strategy context).\nAny strictly dominated strategy is also not a best response, but not all NBR strategies are strictly dominated.\nBecause of this, if we eliminate non-best-responses, using the same steps as IESDS, this process will always eliminate the same strategies, and it may eliminate even more!\nThis process is, naturally, called Iterative Elimination of Non-Best-Responses (IENBR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to this same example, we can start by eliminating B.\n\n\nOnce we do this, we can now see that b and c are non-rationalizable, and eliminate them.\nFinally, we can see that B is non-rationalizable and eliminate it, leaving only the strategy profile (C, a), which is the Nash equilibrium of this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter eliminating Z, which is strictly dominated, what strategy is a non-best-response?\n\nX\nY\nZ\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we complete IENBR on this game table, what strategy profile is left at the end?\n\n(X, x)\n(X, z)\n(Y, x)\n(Y, z)\nThere is more than one strategy profile left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no guarantee that any particular game will contain strategies that are either strictly dominated or non-rationalizable.\nEven when there are strategies we can eliminate, there may not be enough of them to find a NE just by elimination.\nSo why bother with this?\nEven if elimination doesn’t immediately identify a NE, it can still be helpful to simplify the game before trying other methods.\nSimplifying by elimination is especially useful when dealing with mixed strategies—which we’ll get to after the midterm."

The game helps illustrate concepts such as escalation, risk tolerance, and backward induction in strategic situations. It also provides an opportunity to analyze how uncertainty and risk preferences influence negotiation outcomes.\nReference:\nHaun, P., & O’Hara, M. (2022).

    "text": "Game Rules:\nSetup:\nFind a classmate who you haven’t already interacted with in class.\nThe game begins with a pot of 10 coins to be divided between the two of you.\nHave your notebook or device ready to record the results.\nRounds: The game progresses in rounds where one player decides between splitting the pot or rolling a die. Each round increases the risk of escalation, resulting in both players losing everything.\n\nRound 1: Player 1 chooses between:\n\nSplitting the pot (1 coin for themselves and 9 coins for Player 2).\nRolling the die. If the die roll is 1, escalation occurs, and both players receive 0 coins. If the roll is greater than 1, the game proceeds to Round 2.\n\nRound 2: Player 2 chooses between:\n\nSplitting the pot (8 coins for Player 1 and 2 coins for themselves).\nRolling the die. If the roll is 1 or 2, escalation occurs. If the roll is greater than 2, the game proceeds to Round 3.\n\nSubsequent Rounds: Similar logic follows, with the split amounts changing each round:\n\nRound 3: (3, 7)\nRound 4: (6, 4)\nRound 5: (5, 5)\nRound 6: (4, 6)\n\n\nThe risk of escalation increases in each round. By Round 6, rolling the die becomes extremely risky, with only a 1-in-6 chance of avoiding escalation.\nEnd Conditions:\nThe game ends if:\n\nPlayers choose to split the pot in any round.\nEscalation occurs after a low die roll.\nThe sixth round is completed with no escalation."

    "text": "So far, in both sequential and simultaneous games, we have restricted the sets of choices available to our players to finite sets.\n\n\nEven more complicated games like chess have a countable number of strategies available to a player\nWhile this can sometimes make it simpler to solve for games with discrete strategies, in other cases it can make more sense to model the choices to players on some continuum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing/bidding/etc in dollar amounts\n\nEven if there is some minimum unit (like a cent), when there are many options with an obviuous ordering it still makes sense to use continuous values\n\nPositions in space\n\nFor example, you could choose to place your franchise 1 mile away from your competitors, 100 yards, 1 foot etc.,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our model of price competition, we will extend the method of finding discrete best-response strategies to continuous best-response rules\n\nA best-response rule takes the value of another player’s continuous strategy as an input and returns another continuous value as the best response to that strategy\n\n\n\nthis means we can’t use payoff matrices to represent these games anymore,\ninstead we will graph these strategies in Cartesian coordinate systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo restaurants in Yuppie Haven: Xavier’s Tapas Bar and Yvonne’s Bistro.\nEach place serves the exact same menu, can only compete based on how much they charge.\n\nThis makes this game a good application of continuous strategies because there are many different values which a menu price could take.\nAlso, each restaurant’s payoff is represented by a continuous payoff function\n\nIn this case, the payoff is the restaurant’s profit which can take on any dollar value and depends on the price and quantity sold by the competing restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth set prices simultaneously.\nCosts per customer: $8.\nDemand depends on both prices:\n\n\\(Q_X = 44 - 2P_X + P_Y\\)\n\\(Q_Y = 44 - 2P_Y + P_X\\)\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(Q_X\\) is the quantitiy of meals sold and \\(P_X\\) is the price charged by Xavier\n\\(Q_Y\\) is the quantity sold and \\(P_Y\\) is the price charged by Yvonne\n\n\nNotice how each restaurant’s demand depends on thier competitior\n\n\n\n\n\nXavier’s profit is calculated based on his price and number of customers: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi_X & = (\\text{price} - \\text{cost})(\\textbf{quantity sold}) \\\\\n      & = (P_X - 8)\\mathbf{(44 - 2P_X + P_Y)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nYvonne’s profit follows a similar formula.\nHow might we derive the best price for each?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s expand Xavier’s profit function: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi_X & = (P_X - 8)(44 - 2P_X + P_Y) \\\\\n      & = P_X(44 + P_Y - 2P_X) - 8(44 + P_Y - 2P_X)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nLet’s expand Xavier’s profit function: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi_X & = (P_X - 8)(44 - 2P_X + P_Y) \\\\\n      & = P_X(44 + P_Y - 2P_X) - 8(44 + P_Y - 2P_X)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nNow, multiply out the terms:\n\\[\n44 P_X + P_X P_Y - 2 P_X^2 - 352 - 8 P_Y + 16 P_X\n\\]\nWhat should we do next to find the best price?\n\n\n\n\nTo find the best price, we differentiate \\(\\pi_X\\) with respect to \\(P_X\\).\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\pi_X}{dP_X} = 44 + P_Y - 4P_X + 16 = P_Y + 60 - 4P_X\n\\]\nSet the derivative equal to zero for maximization: \\[\nP_Y + 60 - 4P_X = 0\n\\] Solve for \\(P_X\\): \\[\nP_X^* = 15 + 0.25P_Y\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe profit function we wrote out in step 2 seems complicated, so lets simplify it:\n\\[\n\\pi_X = - 352 - 8 P_Y +  \\mathbf{P_X} (60 + P_Y) - 2 \\mathbf{P_X}^2\n\\]\nAs Xavier, we can only set our own price, \\(P_X\\), everything else we can just treat as a constant\nThis fits a more general pattern:\n\\[\nY = A + BX - CX^2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nY = A + BX - CX^2\n\\]\nIf we want to find the maximum of \\(Y\\) in this equation as a function of \\(X\\), as long as \\(C&gt;0\\), this will take the shape of a parabola with a single peak.\n\n\nThe maxmimum of this function will be reached at:\n\\(X^* = \\frac{B}{2C}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo going back to Xavier’s profit function,\n\nIf \\(B = 60 + P_Y\\)\nand \\(C = 2\\)\n\nthen applying that the maximum choice will meet \\(\\frac{B}{2C}\\),\nwe get the same answer of \\(P_X^* = 15 + 0.25P_Y\\)\n\n\n\nYvonne’s problem is symmetric, so we can derive her best-response function similarly: \\[\nP_Y = 15 + 0.25P_X\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nWe have one best response rule for each player as a function of the other player’s pricing strategy\nI.e., a system of two equations and two unknowns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that a NE is a stable configuration of strategies in which each player is best responding to the other\n\n\nSo in this case, when each player is setting a price that maximizes their profits conditional on the other player’s price, there will be no incentive to change price\nIn other words, we can plug in one player’s best response rule into the other player’s best response rule to solve for the equilibrium price\n\n\n\n\n\nWe solve the system of equations for \\(P_X\\) and \\(P_Y\\): \\[\nP_X = 15 + 0.25P_Y\n\\] \\[\nP_Y = 15 + 0.25P_X\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute one equation into the other: \\[\nP_Y = 15 + 0.25(15 + 0.25P_Y)\n\\] Simplify: \\[\nP_Y = 15 + 3.75 + 0.0625P_Y\n\\] Solve for \\(P_Y\\): \\[\nP_Y = 20\n\\]\nThen, plug \\(P_Y = 20\\) back into the first equation: \\[\nP_X = 15 + 0.25(20) = 20\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nAt equilibrium:\n\n\\(P_X = 20\\), \\(P_Y = 20\\)\nBoth restaurants charge $20, serve 2,400 customers per month, and make a monthly profit of $28,800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Expand the profit function.\nStep 2: Simplify the expanded equation.\nStep 3: Differentiate and solve for best-response.\nStep 4: Repeat for Yvonne.\nStep 5: Solve for Nash equilibrium."

Alternative solution concepts may provide better insights into certain situations, but Nash equilibrium is still the starting point for analyzing many strategic games."

The firms simultaneously decide how much product to produce, which they then sell at a price determined by that market demand curve.\nThis is a game with two players (the firms), and continuous strategies (the firms must pick a quantity to produce, which can be any non-negative real number).\nIn this example, we will use the following values:\n\nMarket Demand Curve: \\(Q = 100 - P\\), in which \\(Q = q_1 + q_2\\)\nCost Functions: \\(c_i(q_i) = 10q_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we need payoff functions for each player.\nSince the players are firms, and the goal of a firm is to maximize profit, we’ll use the firms’ profits as their payoffs.\nWe can construct the profit functions by taking TR - TC, or in this case, Pq - c(q).\nSolving for P, we find that \\(P = 100 - Q = 100 - q_1 - q_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi_1 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_1 - 10q_1 & \\pi_2 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_2 - 10q_2\\\\\n&= 100q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 - 10q_1 & &= 100q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2 - 10q_2\\\\\n&= 90q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 & &= 90q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2\\\\\n&= (90 - q_2)q_1 - q_1^2 & &= (90 - q_1)q_2 - q_2^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThese best-response functions are in the by-now familiar quadratic form. Both of them have negative squared terms, so we can look for a maximum: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_1 &= \\frac{-(90 - q_2)}{2(-1)} & q_2 &= \\frac{-(90 - q_1)}{2(-1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{90 - q_2}{2} & &= \\frac{90 - q_1}{2}\\\\\n&= 45 - \\frac{q_2}{2} & &= 45 - \\frac{q_1}{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSolve these best-response rules as a system of equations: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_1 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}q_2\\\\\nq_2 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}q_1\\\\\n\\implies q_1 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}(45 - \\frac{1}{2}q_1) & q_2 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}(30)\\\\\nq_1 &= 45 - \\frac{45}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}q_1 & &= 45 - 15\\\\\n\\frac{3}{4}q_1 &= \\frac{45}{2} & q_2^* &= \\boxed{30}\\\\\nq_1^* &= \\boxed{30}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCrude oil is transported across the globe in enormous tanker ships called Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). By 2001, more than 92% of all new VLCCs were built in South Korea and Japan. Assume that the price of new VLCCs (in millions of dollars) is determined by the function \\(P = 180 - Q\\), where \\(Q = q_{Korea} + q_{Japan}\\). (That is, assume that only Japan and Korea produce VLCCs, so they are a duopoly.) Assume that the cost of building each ship is $30 million in both Korea and Japan. That is, \\(c_{Korea} = c_{Japan} = 30\\), where the per-ship cost is measured in millions of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an oligopoly:\n\nFirms’ prices (quantities) are interdependent.\nThe best-response functions allow us to determine equilibrium prices (or quantities in Bertrand).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s extend this:\n\nWhat happens when a third firm enters the market?\n\nWould prices fall?

Record every kick\nAfter each kick, make sure to record both players’ strategies as well whether a goal was scored.\nGoogle Sheet for Recording: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1soh4vh9bWGs3yhY0A8mQfTR7tYmRYLN-OoSdAxfyOc4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAlternate between you and your opponent being the kicker and goalie until you have both attempted 5 shots each.\nIf there is a tie after 5 kicks each, you will enter sudden death where you keep alternating kicks until one player scores and the other misses.\n\n\n\n4. Repeat with a new opponent\nFind your next opponent in the bracket. If you are knocked out of the bracket, find someone else to play against for fun, or observe the competitions of others.\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| standalone: true\n#| code-fold: false\n#| label: soccer-penalty-shootout\n#| viewerHeight: 600\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define the goal probabilities matrix\ngoal_probabilities &lt;- matrix(\n  c(0.3, 0.9, 0.9,\n    0.6, 0.0, 0.6,\n    0.9, 0.9, 0.3),\n  nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE,\n  dimnames = list(Kicker = c(\"Left\", \"Center\", \"Right\"), Goalie = c(\"Left\", \"Center\", \"Right\"))\n)\n\n# User interface\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n    titlePanel(\"Soccer Penalty Shootout Simulation\"),\n    \n    sidebarLayout(\n        sidebarPanel(\n            # Coin flip button and display\n            actionButton(\"coin_flip\", \"Flip Coin to Decide Kicker\"),\n            textOutput(\"coin_result\"),\n            \n            # Strategy selection\n            selectInput(\"kicker_choice\", \"Kicker's Strategy:\", choices = c(\"Left\", \"Center\", \"Right\")),\n            selectInput(\"goalie_choice\", \"Goalie's Strategy:\", choices = c(\"Left\", \"Center\", \"Right\")),\n            \n            # Button to simulate outcome and display result\n            actionButton(\"shoot\", \"Take Shot\"),\n            textOutput(\"outcome_result\")\n        ),\n        \n        mainPanel(\n            # Display probability table for reference\n            h4(\"Goal Probability Table\"),\n            tableOutput(\"probability_table\")\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n# Server logic\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n    # Display probability table in the UI\n    output$probability_table &lt;- renderTable({\n        as.data.frame(goal_probabilities)\n    }, rownames = TRUE)\n    \n    # Coin flip logic\n    output$coin_result &lt;- renderText({\n        input$coin_flip\n        isolate({\n            if (input$coin_flip &gt; 0) {\n                result &lt;- sample(c(\"Kicker goes first!\", \"Goalie goes first!\"), 1)\n                paste(\"Coin Flip Result:\", result)\n            }\n        })\n    })\n    \n    # Shoot outcome logic\n    output$outcome_result &lt;- renderText({\n        input$shoot\n        isolate({\n            if (input$shoot &gt; 0) {\n                kicker &lt;- input$kicker_choice\n                goalie &lt;- input$goalie_choice\n                prob_goal &lt;- goal_probabilities[kicker, goalie]\n                \n                # Randomize outcome based on the goal probability\n                outcome &lt;- ifelse(runif(1) &lt; prob_goal, \"Goal!\", \"Missed!\")\n                paste(\"Kicker's choice:\", kicker, \"| Goalie's choice:\", goalie, \"| Result:\", outcome)\n            }\n        })\n    })\n}\n\n# Run the app\nshinyApp(ui, server)",
