The police put them in separate cells and offer each prisoner a choice.\nIf both cooperate with the investigation, they will get a lighter sentence of 10 years.\nIf either one agrees to testify but not the other, the one who cooperated will go free and the one who didn’t gets a full 20 years.\nIf neither cooperates, the prosecutor won’t have enough of a case and the criminals will only serve 1 year each for misdemeanors."
