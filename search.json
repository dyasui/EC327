The firms simultaneously decide how much product to produce, which they then sell at a price determined by that market demand curve.\nThis is a game with two players (the firms), and continuous strategies (the firms must pick a quantity to produce, which can be any non-negative real number).\nIn this example, we will use the following values:\n\nMarket Demand Curve: \\(Q = 100 - P\\), in which \\(Q = q_1 + q_2\\)\nCost Functions: \\(c_i(q_i) = 10q_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, we need payoff functions for each player.\nSince the players are firms, and the goal of a firm is to maximize profit, we’ll use the firms’ profits as their payoffs.\nWe can construct the profit functions by taking TR - TC, or in this case, Pq - c(q).\nSolving for P, we find that \\(P = 100 - Q = 100 - q_1 - q_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\pi_1 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_1 - 10q_1 & \\pi_2 &= (100 - q_1 - q_2)q_2 - 10q_2\\\\\n&= 100q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 - 10q_1 & &= 100q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2 - 10q_2\\\\\n&= 90q_1 - q_1^2 - q_1q_2 & &= 90q_2 - q_1q_2 - q_2^2\\\\\n&= (90 - q_2)q_1 - q_1^2 & &= (90 - q_1)q_2 - q_2^2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThese best-response functions are in the by-now familiar quadratic form. Both of them have negative squared terms, so we can look for a maximum: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_1 &= \\frac{-(90 - q_2)}{2(-1)} & q_2 &= \\frac{-(90 - q_1)}{2(-1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{90 - q_2}{2} & &= \\frac{90 - q_1}{2}\\\\\n&= 45 - \\frac{q_2}{2} & &= 45 - \\frac{q_1}{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSolve these best-response rules as a system of equations: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_1 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}q_2\\\\\nq_2 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}q_1\\\\\n\\implies q_1 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}(45 - \\frac{1}{2}q_1) & q_2 &= 45 - \\frac{1}{2}(30)\\\\\nq_1 &= 45 - \\frac{45}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}q_1 & &= 45 - 15\\\\\n\\frac{3}{4}q_1 &= \\frac{45}{2} & q_2^* &= \\boxed{30}\\\\\nq_1^* &= \\boxed{30}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCrude oil is transported across the globe in enormous tanker ships called Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). By 2001, more than 92% of all new VLCCs were built in South Korea and Japan. Assume that the price of new VLCCs (in millions of dollars) is determined by the function \\(P = 180 - Q\\), where \\(Q = q_{Korea} + q_{Japan}\\). (That is, assume that only Japan and Korea produce VLCCs, so they are a duopoly.) Assume that the cost of building each ship is $30 million in both Korea and Japan. That is, \\(c_{Korea} = c_{Japan} = 30\\), where the per-ship cost is measured in millions of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an oligopoly:\n\nFirms’ prices (quantities) are interdependent.\nThe best-response functions allow us to determine equilibrium prices (or quantities in Bertrand).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s extend this:\n\nWhat happens when a third firm enters the market?\n\nWould prices fall? Would all three firms set similar prices?\nOr would competition force one firm out of the market?\n\n\nDiscuss!"

To be strictly dominated, there must be one particular strategy** which is always better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the game below, there are no strictly dominated strategies, meaning that IESDS will not do anything to simplify it.\n\n\nHowever, we can see that B is non-rationalizable for Player 1: regardless of whether Player 2 chooses a, b, or c, Player 1 is better off playing either A or C.\nAlso, b is non-rationalizable for Player 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not rational to play a non-best-response strategy in a pure-strategy context. (As we’ll see much later, it’s more complicated in a mixed-strategy context).\nAny strictly dominated strategy is also not a best response, but not all NBR strategies are strictly dominated.\nBecause of this, if we eliminate non-best-responses, using the same steps as IESDS, this process will always eliminate the same strategies, and it may eliminate even more!\nThis process is, naturally, called Iterative Elimination of Non-Best-Responses (IENBR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to this same example, we can start by eliminating B.\n\n\nOnce we do this, we can now see that b and c are non-rationalizable, and eliminate them.\nFinally, we can see that B is non-rationalizable and eliminate it, leaving only the strategy profile (C, a), which is the Nash equilibrium of this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter eliminating Z, which is strictly dominated, what strategy is a non-best-response?\n\nX\nY\nZ\ny\nz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we complete IENBR on this game table, what strategy profile is left at the end?\n\n(X, x)\n(X, z)\n(Y, x)\n(Y, z)\nThere is more than one strategy profile left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no guarantee that any particular game will contain strategies that are either strictly dominated or non-rationalizable.\nEven when there are strategies we can eliminate, there may not be enough of them to find a NE just by elimination.\nSo why bother with this?\nEven if elimination doesn’t immediately identify a NE, it can still be helpful to simplify the game before trying other methods.\nSimplifying by elimination is especially useful when dealing with mixed strategies—which we’ll get to after the midterm."
