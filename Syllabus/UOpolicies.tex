\section*{University Policies:\footnote{Adapted from UO TEP's starter syllabus}}

The UO Economics Department welcomes and respects diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. Both nationwide and at the University of Oregon, disproportionately few women and members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups graduate with degrees in economics. All class participants are expected to communicate with respect and to avoid behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status.

I believe that everyone deserves an equal access to higher education.
If you believe that you face specific barriers to your learning that make it more difficult to keep up with your peers, there are resources at UO to help you.

A (non-exhaustive) list of acts which can be considered \textbf{academic misconduct} in this class:

\begin{itemize}
\item Taking a quiz or exam for another person, or providing answers to a quiz or exam question to someone else.
\item \href{https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism}{Plagiarising}, or someone else's work on a homework assignment without saying who it came from.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Your Wellbeing and Basic Needs:}

Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life.
If you're facing such challenges, you don't need to handle them on your own--there's help and support on campus. 
As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I will express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to resources that might be helpful.
It is not my intention to know the details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I care and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to do—for yourself and those you care about. 

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{University Health Services}: (located in the EMU on the ground floor) Help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. You can talk to a specially trained Peer Wellness Advocate about problems you are facing.

\item \href{https://counseling.uoregon.edu}{\textbf{University Counseling Services (UCS)}}: Offers free and confidential clinical counseling services, wellbeing assesments, in-person, hybrid, or teletherapy options.
Call 541-346-3227 if UCS is closed to access the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line.

\item \href{https://basicneeds.uoregon.edu/}{\textbf{UO Basic Needs}}:
They have information on food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances (including emergency funds), and legal support.

\item If your need is \textbf{\color{darkred} urgent}, contact the \href{https://dos.uoregon.edu/help}{Care and Advocacy Program} by calling \textbf{\color{darkred}541-346-3216}, filling out the Community Care and Support form, or by scheduling an appointment with an advocate.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Accommodations for Religious Observances:}
