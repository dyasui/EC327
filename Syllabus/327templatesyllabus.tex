\subsection*{Objectives:}

This course aims to help you to understand the fundamental principles of game theory, become familiar with basic classes of games, practice the mathematical skills to solve for the appropriate equilibria, apply game theoretic models to real-world interactions, and recognize limitations and critiques of the theory.

\subsection*{Textbook:}

  \textit{Games of Strategy} by Avinash Dixit, Susan Skeath, and David McAdams, published by W.W. Norton.
  E-book versions are available from the \href{https://wwnorton.com/books/Games-of-Strategy}{publisher}.
  
\subsubsection*{Additional Sources:}

  I also like Joseph E. Harrington, \textit{Games Strategies and Decision Making}, Worth Publishers, 2008.
  % Giacomo Bonanno, \textit{Game Theory}, $2^{nd}$ edition, 2018: is a free open source game theory textbook available here; \url{https://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/PDF/GT_book.pdf}, but it is a lot more technical and math heavy.

 \noindent Any other readings I assign (for example articles, news stories, etc.) will be posted on Canvas.

\subsection*{Prerequisites:}

  One of EC101 or EC201.

\subsection*{Attendance:}

  Regular attendance is essential and expected.

\hypertarget{grading_activity}{\subsection{In-class Activities}}

  During class times, we will sometimes play games where you will be asked to break into groups and play a short game that relates to ideas we are learning.
  You will be asked to record what happens during the activity so that we can collect and analyze the class's data.
  Your Activities grade will be determinded by your participation (i.e., were you present, respectful, and engaged) as well as a short paragraph where you debrief the activity and relate it to class content.

  \hypertarget{grading_HW}{\subsection{Homework}}

  Several homework assignments will be posted on Canvas throughout the term. You will post your submissions as \textit{a single pdf file} including all work. You will be graded according to the rubric posted on Canvas. 
  Answer keys will be automatically posted on the due date in Canvas, so no late submissions will be accepted. However, your lowest grade will be dropped at the end of the term.

 
\hypertarget{grading_exam}{\subsection{Exams:}}
  There will be one midterm in week 5 and one final exam administered at the time specified in the Registrar’s final exam schedule.
  If a student cannot attend the midterm due to extreme circumstances, a re-weighting of the student’s grade towards the final may be considered.
  To qualify for re-weighting, a request must be submitted to the instructor no later than two days after the midterm.
