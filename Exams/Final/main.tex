\textit{For the next three questions, 
match the example given with the concept from class that is the most closely related to the specific strategic setting.}

\begin{question}[type=exam]{4}
  Web servers want to provide their content to real human users 
  while also keeping out `bots' which are programs that can mimic human users to bump up engagement numbers, etc. 
  Sometimes websites will make you fill out a `captcha' test,
  like clicking all of the pictures with street lights,
  in an effort to tell which users are humans and which are bots.

\begin{question}[type=exam]{4}
  Every year during Oscars season, Hollywood studios spend millions on media campaigns to hype up their movies to potential Oscars awards voters. 
  If no-one did any advertising, then these studios would all spend less money. 
  But if one studio was the only one advertising, then their movies would probably win more often than competing studios' movies.

\begin{question}[type=exam]{4}
  When I am writing these multiple choice problems
  I try to vary the order in which the correct choice appears among the options
  to try to make it harder to guess all of the right answers.
  \setlist{nolistsep}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*), noitemsep]
    \item \vary{Mixed strategy}{Mixed strategy}
    \item \vary{Pure strategy}{Pure strategy} 
    \item \vary{Tit-for-Tat strategy}{Screening strategy} 
    \item \vary{Cheap talk strategy}{Grim Trigger strategy}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\textit{The next few questions are related to examples we saw in class}

\begin{question}[type=exam]{4}
  Consider the tennis match below:
  \begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cc|c|c|}
    & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Navratilova}\\
    & \multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$DL$}  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$CC$} \\\cline{3-4}
    \multirow{2}*{Evert}  & $DL$ & $50, 50$ & $80,20$ \\\cline{3-4}
                          & $CC$ & $90, 10$ & $20,80$ \\\cline{3-4}
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  Suppose that Evert can add a first stage move in which she can either say 
  ``I will serve Down the Line (DL)'' or ``I will serve Cross-Court (CC)''.

  What will happen in equilibrium?
  \setlist{nolistsep}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*), noitemsep]
    \item \vary
    {Evert will truthfully signal her strategy $DL$, Navratilova will believe her and play $DL$}
    {No matter what Evert says, Navratilova will never believe her. Both will randomize between $DL$ and $CC$} % correct
    \item \vary
    {Evert will lie by saying she will play $DL$ but actually play $CC$, Navratilova will believe her and play $DL$}
    {Evert will lie by saying she will play $DL$ but actually play $CC$, Navratilova won't believe her so she'll play $CC$}
    \item \vary
    {Evert will lie by saying she will play $DL$ but actually play $CC$, Navratilova won't believe her so she'll play $CC$}
    {Evert will lie by saying she will play $DL$ but actually play $CC$, Navratilova will believe her and play $DL$}
    \item \vary
    {No matter what Evert says, Navratilova will never believe her. Both will randomize between $DL$ and $CC$} % correct
    {Evert will truthfully signal her strategy $DL$, Navratilova will believe her and play $DL$}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}[type=exam]{4}
  In Akerlof's original Market for Lemons, there were only two types of used cars; good cars and lemons (bad cars).
  Only the seller of the used car knows the true quality of their car, potential buyers do not.

  What happened in the Adverse Selection equilibrium?
  \setlist{nolistsep}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*), noitemsep]
    \item \vary
    {Good cars sold for high prices, bad cars sold for low prices}
    {No cars were sold}
    \item \vary
    {No cars were sold}
    {Good cars sold for high prices, bad cars sold for low prices}
    \item \vary
    {Only bad cars were sold, good cars were never sold} % correct
    {All cars were sold for high prices}
    \item \vary
    {All cars were sold for high prices}
    {Only bad cars were sold, good cars were never sold} % correct
  \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}[type=exam]{4}
  In the in-class activity \textit{Penalty Shootout Tournament}, 
  we broke into pairs of one kicker and one goalie who had to simultaneously choose either \textit{Left}, \textit{Middle}, or \textit{Right}.
  The goalie scored 1 point if they chose the same direction as the kicker, otherwise the kicker scored 1 point.

  Compare the theoretical prediction to what we actually observed in the data:
  \setlist{nolistsep}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*), noitemsep]
    \item \vary
    {The theory told us that the kicker should only choose \textit{Left}, but in the data many people actually chose \textit{Right}}
    {The theory told us that a mixed strategy profile of both players playing 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 was an equilibrium, and the class data were very close to the frequencies we predicted} % correct
    \item \vary
    {The theory told us that both types of players should mix strategies, but in the data most people only stuck to one choice}
    {The theory predicted the exact same outcomes as we saw in the class data}
    \item \vary
    {The theory told us that a mixed strategy profile of both players playing 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 was an equilibrium, and the class data were very close to the frequencies we predicted} % correct
    {The theory told us that both types of players should mix strategies, but in the data most people only stuck to one choice}
    \item \vary
    {The theory predicted the exact same outcomes as we saw in the class data}
    {The theory told us that the kicker should only choose \textit{Left}, but in the data many people actually chose \textit{Right}}
  \end{enumerate}

Choose from either \textbf{0}, \textbf{1}, \textbf{2}, or \textbf{3} possible bonus points to receive.
I will randomly pair you with another student. 
If the sum of the points chosen from both of you is four or less, you will each receive the number of bonus points you individually selected.
However if the sum is more than four, you will receive 0 bonus points.
