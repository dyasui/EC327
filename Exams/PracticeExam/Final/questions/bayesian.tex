\begin{question}[ID=StudentBoard,type=exam]{12}
\textbf{Bayesian Game:}
Consider a situation in which a student can decide to cheat or be honest on an exam.
If the faculty thinks the student has cheated, 
the faculty member has to decide whether to expel them from the college
or refer them to the Honor Board. 
The Honor Board has to decide whether to expel the student or find them innocent.
The payoffs are ordered, student, faculty, and college.
Assume the board shares the college's payoffs.

    \PrintSolutionsTF{ \fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{
      In the semi-separating equilibrium above, the \texttt{College} strategy has signaling value. \\
      The signal of college gives the Manager a better idea of the Employee's true type than their naive estimate of $p=2/3$.
      $$
      prob(\text{A} | \texttt{College}) =
