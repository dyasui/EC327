\begin{question}[type=exam]{16}
  
  Consider the strategic form game below: 

  \begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{*{4}{c|}}
      \multicolumn{2}{c}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Column} \\ \cline{3-4}
      \multicolumn{1}{c}{} &         & Cooperate & Defect \\ \cline{2-4}
      \multirow{2}*{Row} & Cooperate & 8  , 8 & 0, 10 \\ \cline{2-4}
                         & Defect    & 10 , 0 & 3 , 3 \\ \cline{2-4} 
    \end{tabular} 
  \end{table} 

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]

    \item (\points{4})
    What will happen when this game is a \textit{one-shot} game and neither player can make any strategic moves?
    \vspace{2cm}

    \item (\points{2})
    Will this outcome be \textit{Pareto optimal}?
    \vspace{2cm}

    \item (\points{4})
    What could you change about the structure of this game to ensure that a socially optimal outcome will be reached in equilibrium? 
    \vspace{3cm}

    \item (\points{6})
    Suppose that both players have a \textit{discount factor} of $\delta=3/4$.
    Can a strategy profile of both players using \textit{grim trigger} strategies 
    be sustained in the game where the strategic form game above is repeated infinitely?

    Show all calculations and explain your answer.
