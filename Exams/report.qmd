# Average Performance by Question

![](F25-mt-question-breakdown.png)

* The most difficult multiple choice questions were Q6 and Q10.
* Question 11 was out of 6, but most people scored lower than 4 points.
* Many people got most of the points on Q12.
* In Q13 and Q14, many people got most credit on parts a and b 
  - But parts c and d were more challenging.
  - A few people were able to earn full credit on these parts, good job!

# Bonus Question Distribution

For everyone who answered the bonus question,
I matched you with another random exam.
If your bid was (strictly) less than the other person's,
then I added your bid to your score.
The average bid was 0.73
and about twenty people were able to earn bonus points (on average only 0.26).

# Class Midterm Performance Overall

![](F25-mt-score-distribution.png)

Overall, the average score on the midterm was around a 64 (out of 90)^[before bonus points].
This works out to about about 70%, or a C minus.
However, most people did better than the average;
the median score was 68 and the modal score was 70.
