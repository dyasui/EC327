## **Chapter 1&2: What is Game Theory?**

**Main Ideas**

* Strategic situations occur whenever individuals’ choices depend on others’ actions.
* Distinguishes between **decisions** (individual optimization) and **strategic games** (mutual interdependence).
* Classifying games: sequential vs. simultaneous, one-shot vs. repeated, complete vs. incomplete information.

**Key Terms**

* **Game of strategy**: a situation where each player’s payoff depends on the actions of others.
* **Strategic** choice vs other types of maximizing behavior
* **Elements of games**: players, strategies, payoffs, information.
* **Strategies**: complete plans of action for every contingency.
* **Payoffs**: numerical representation of preferences or outcomes.
* **Equilibrium**: a stable configuration of choices
* **Expected payoff** 
* **Rationality**
* **Pareto efficiency**: a social outcome that no-one would veto
* **Cooperative vs. Noncooperative games**
* **Zero-sum** (or constant-sum) vs games with incentives to cooperate
* **One-shot** vs **Repeated** games (we've only represented one-shot games so far)

## **Chapter 3: Games with Sequential Moves**

**Main Ideas**

* Analyzes games where players move in sequence.
* Introduces **game trees** and **rollback (backward induction)** reasoning.

**Key Concepts**

* **Game tree (extensive form)**: diagrams of decision nodes, branches, and terminal payoffs.
* **Backwards Induction (Rollback equilibrium)**: find the equilibrium by solving backward from the end of the game.
  - "pruning" branches that are part of sequentially dominated strategies
* **First-mover vs. second-mover advantage**
* **Subgame**: portion of a game that constitutes a smaller game starting at a node.
* **Order advantage**
* Empirical evidence for Rollback: **centipede** and **ultimatum** games.

## **Chapter 4: Simultaneous-Move Games with Discrete Strategies**

**Main Ideas**

* Players choose actions simultaneously.
* Introduces **payoff matrices**, **dominance**, and **Nash equilibrium**.

**Key Concepts**

* **Normal form (matrix representation)**
* **Dominant strategy**: best response regardless of what others do.
* **Dominated strategy**: always worse than another available strategy.
* **Iterated elimination of dominated strategies**
* **Nash equilibrium**: *list of strategies* where no player can gain by deviating unilaterally.
* **Best response** to an opponent's strategy
* **Best response analysis**
* **Types of games**:
  - **coordination games**: Battle of the Sexes, Deer Hunt, assurance games
  - **anti-coordination games**: chicken
  - **prisoners' dilemma**

## **Chapter 5: Simultaneous-Move Games with Continuous Strategies**

**Main Ideas**

* Extends Nash equilibrium to settings with continuous strategy spaces (e.g., price, quantity).
* Introduces calculus-based optimization.
* Discusses empirical criticisms and **rationalizability**.

**Key Concepts**

* **Best response rules (functions)**
* **Cournot** (quantity) and **Bertrand** (price) competition

Helpful shortcut for the max of a quadratic of form
$f(x) = A + Bx + Cx^2$:

when $x=\frac{B}{2C}$, $f(x)$ is at a maximum.

## **Chapter 6: Games with Sequential and Simultaneous Moves**

**Main Ideas**

* Combines tree and matrix reasoning.
* Analyzes games with both types of moves (e.g., entry games, Stackelberg competition).

**Key Concepts**

* **Information set**: what actions are observable by a player before they move
* Going from **extensive** to **normal** form in the same game
* **Subgame-perfect equilibrium**
* **credibility**
* **off-equilibrium paths**
